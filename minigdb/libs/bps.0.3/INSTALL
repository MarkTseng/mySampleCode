Install
-------

Edit the Makefile so that the variable ARCH is correct.

For x86 (32 bit), use ARCH=-DARCHX86   (this is the current setting).
For ARM (v4-v6), use ARCH=-DARCHARM

You can easily change it from the current X86 setting to ARM with:
$ sed -i -e 's/ARCHX86/ARCHARM/' Makefile

You should then be able to just run 'make'.
