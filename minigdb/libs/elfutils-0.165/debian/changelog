  * Application in the readelf binary package, libdw1 itself use internal
    APIs from libelf and so need a strict dependency on the same libelf1
    binary package.  libasm1 also needs a strict dependency on libdw1 since
    it uses libebl.a and so uses the MODVERSION to open the backends.  The
    dependency from libasm1 to libdw1 was missing.
    Disabling the thread safety resulted in struct Elf's size changing
    causing things like eu-readelf to break when an older libelf1 was

  [ Kurt Roeckx ]
  * The backends init functions should be functions, not pointers
    to functions.  Also thanks to Eugeniy Meshcheryakov
    for pointing out the same.  This should fix the segmentation faults
    seen on ia64.
  * When doing x && y &, bash retuns the pid for x, while the script
    expected the one for y.  Other shells I've tried return that of y.
    As a result the run-native-test.sh keeps a "native" process running.
    Removed the &&, so it always gets the correct pid.  (Closes: #382758)
  * Fix endiannes problems for opening files of your own endiannes
    when not avoiding unaligned access.  This didn't affect
    i386 and amd64.
