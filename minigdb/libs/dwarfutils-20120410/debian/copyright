The code in the dwarfdump directory is (if you look
in each file) covered by the GPL (not the LGPL).  The
DWARFDUMPCOPYRIGHT file, though, said (before December 24,
2006) the copyright is LGPL.  There is no doubt in my (David
Anderson) mind that the intent was always that dwarfdump be
GPL and the copyright markings in each file are correct.
