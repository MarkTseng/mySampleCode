The dwarf documentation:
	dwarf.v2.mm and its postscript form and its
	indexes are copyright Unix International (UI is now defunct).  
        One presumes XOPEN owns the copyright now. In any case copying
	and revision without fee is permitted (see the
	copyright in the document).

The libdwarf documentation:
	libdwarf2.1.mm
	is based on material submitted to the UI PLSIG as proposed
	interfaces for dwarf, but completely rewritten.  
        Copyright ownership is therefore SGI (but see the document for details)  
        and it seems clear that the intent was there was to be free
	copying with no fees.

        libdwarf2p.1.mm
        is documentation of a set of interfaces 
        (not part of the UI PLSIG proposals)
        and the document was written from scratch at SGI.
        Copyright ownership is therefore SGI (but see the document for details)  
        and it seems clear that the intent was there was to be free
	copying with no fees.
