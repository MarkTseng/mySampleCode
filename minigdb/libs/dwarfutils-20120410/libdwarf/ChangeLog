     * libdwarf.h: A pointer "*" was right next to
       a "/*" so a space introduced between them for clarity.
       Fixed comments on DW_DLC_SIZE_64 and DW_DLC_SIZE_32.
     * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Two local variables were declared in the
       middle of code, accidentally creating C99 dependencies.
       Both trivially fixed with no change in logic.
