.. module:: time
    :synopsis: Functions for manipulating clock time

:Purpose: Functions for manipulating clock time.
:Python Version: 1.4 or earlier

The :mod:`time` module exposes C library functions for manipulating
dates and times.  Since it is tied to the underlying C implementation,
some details (such as the start of the epoch and maximum date value
supported) are platform-specific.  Refer to the library documentation
for complete details.

Wall Clock Time
===============

One of the core functions of the :mod:`time` module is :func:`time()`,
which returns the number of seconds since the start of the epoch as a
floating point value.

.. include:: time_time.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Although the value is always a float, actual precision is
platform-dependent.

::

    $ python time_time.py
    The time is: 1205079300.54

The float representation is useful when storing or comparing dates,
but not as useful for producing human readable representations. For
logging or printing time :func:`ctime()` can be more useful.

.. include:: time_ctime.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Here the second output line shows how to use :func:`ctime()` to format
a time value other than the current time.

::

    $ python time_ctime.py
    The time is      : Sun Mar  9 12:18:02 2008
    15 secs from now : Sun Mar  9 12:18:17 2008

Processor Clock Time
====================

While :func:`time()` returns a wall clock time, :func:`clock()`
returns processor clock time.  The values returned from
:func:`clock()` should be used for performance testing, benchmarking,
etc. since they reflect the actual time used by the program, and can
be more precise than the values from :func:`time()`.

.. include:: time_clock.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header


In this example, the formatted :func:`ctime()` is printed along with
the floating point values from :func:`time()`, and :func:`clock()` for
each iteration through the loop. If you want to run the example on
your system, you may have to add more cycles to the inner loop or work
with a larger amount of data to actually see a difference.

::

    $ python time_clock.py
    Sun Mar  9 12:41:53 2008 : 1205080913.260 0.030
    Sun Mar  9 12:41:53 2008 : 1205080913.682 0.440
    Sun Mar  9 12:41:54 2008 : 1205080914.103 0.860
    Sun Mar  9 12:41:54 2008 : 1205080914.518 1.270
    Sun Mar  9 12:41:54 2008 : 1205080914.932 1.680

Typically, the processor clock doesn't tick if your program isn't doing
anything.

.. include:: time_clock_sleep.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

In this example, the loop does very little work by going to sleep
after each iteration. The :func:`time()` value increases even while
the app is asleep, but the :func:`clock()` value does not.

::

    $ python time_clock_sleep.py
    Sun Mar  9 12:46:36 2008 1205081196.20 0.02
    Sleeping 6
    Sun Mar  9 12:46:42 2008 1205081202.20 0.02
    Sleeping 5
    Sun Mar  9 12:46:47 2008 1205081207.20 0.02
    Sleeping 4
    Sun Mar  9 12:46:51 2008 1205081211.20 0.02
    Sleeping 3
    Sun Mar  9 12:46:54 2008 1205081214.21 0.02
    Sleeping 2

Calling :func:`sleep()` yields control from the current thread and
asks it to wait for the system to wake it back up. If your program has
only one thread, this effectively blocks the app and it does no work.

struct_time
===========

Storing times as elapsed seconds is useful in some situations, but
there are times when you need to have access to the individual fields
of a date (year, month, etc.). The :mod:`time` module defines
:class:`struct_time` for holding date and time values with components
broken out so they are easy to access. There are several functions
that work with :class:`struct_time` values instead of floats.

.. include:: time_struct.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

:func:`gmtime()` returns the current time in UTC. :func:`localtime()`
returns the current time with the current time zone
applied. :func:`mktime()` takes a :class:`struct_time` and converts it
to the floating point representation.

::

    $ python time_struct.py
    gmtime   : (2008, 3, 9, 16, 58, 19, 6, 69, 0)
    localtime: (2008, 3, 9, 12, 58, 19, 6, 69, 1)
    mktime   : 1205081899.0

    Day of month: 9
     Day of week: 6
     Day of year: 69


Parsing and Formatting Times
============================

The two functions :func:`strptime()` and :func:`strftime()` convert
between struct_time and string representations of time values. There
is a long list of formatting instructions available to support input
and output in different styles. The complete list is documented in the
library documentation for the time module.

This example converts the current time from a string, to a
:class:`struct_time` instance, and back to a string.

.. include:: time_strptime.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The output string is not exactly like the input, since the day of the
month is prefixed with a zero.

::

    $ python time_strptime.py
    Sun Mar  9 13:01:19 2008
    (2008, 3, 9, 13, 1, 19, 6, 69, -1)
    Sun Mar 09 13:01:19 2008

Working with Time Zones
=======================

The functions for determining the current time depend on having the time zone
set, either by your program or by using a default time zone set for the
system. Changing the time zone does not change the actual time, just the way
it is represented.

To change the time zone, set the environment variable ``TZ``, then
call :func:`tzset()`.  Using TZ, you can specify the time zone with a
lot of detail, right down to the start and stop times for daylight
savings time. It is usually easier to use the time zone name and let
the underlying libraries derive the other information, though.

This example program changes the time zone to a few different values
and shows how the changes affect other settings in the time module.

.. include:: time_timezone.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

My default time zone is US/Eastern, so setting TZ to that has no
effect. The other zones used change the tzname, daylight flag, and
timezone offset value.

::

    $ python time_timezone.py
    Default :
        TZ    : (not set)
        tzname: ('EST', 'EDT')
        Zone  : 18000 (5)
        DST   : 1
        Time  : Sun Mar  9 13:06:53 2008

    US/Eastern :
        TZ    : US/Eastern
        tzname: ('EST', 'EDT')
        Zone  : 18000 (5)
        DST   : 1
        Time  : Sun Mar  9 13:06:53 2008

    US/Pacific :
        TZ    : US/Pacific
        tzname: ('PST', 'PDT')
        Zone  : 28800 (8)
        DST   : 1
        Time  : Sun Mar  9 10:06:53 2008

    GMT :
        TZ    : GMT
        tzname: ('GMT', 'GMT')
        Zone  : 0 (0)
        DST   : 0
        Time  : Sun Mar  9 17:06:53 2008

    Europe/Amsterdam :
        TZ    : Europe/Amsterdam
        tzname: ('CET', 'CEST')
        Zone  : -3600 (-1)
        DST   : 1
        Time  : Sun Mar  9 18:06:53 2008
