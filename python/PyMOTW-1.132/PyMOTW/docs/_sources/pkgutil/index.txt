 pkgutil -- Package Utilities
==============================

.. module:: pkgutil
    :synopsis: Package utilities

:Purpose: Add to the module search path for a specific package and work with resources included in a package.
:Python Version: 2.3 and later

The :mod:`pkgutil` module includes functions for working with Python
packages.  :func:`extend_path` changes the import path for sub-modules
of the package, and :func:`get_data` provides access to file resources
distributed with the package.

Package Import Paths
====================

The :func:`extend_path` function is used to modify the search path for
modules in a given package to include other directories in
:ref:`sys.path <sys-path>`. This can be used to override installed
versions of packages with development versions, or to combine
platform-specific and shared modules into a single package namespace.

The most common way to call :func:`extend_path` is by adding these two
lines to the ``__init__.py`` inside the packag:

e::

    import pkgutil
    __path__ = pkgutil.extend_path(__path__, __name__)

:func:`extend_path` scans ``sys.path`` for directories that include a
subdirectory named for the package given as the second argument.  The
list of directories is combined with the path value passed as the
first argument and returned as a single list, suitable for use as the
package import path.

An example package called :mod:`demopkg` includes these files:

::

    $ find demopkg1 -name '*.py'
    demopkg1/__init__.py
    demopkg1/shared.py

``demopkg1/__init__.py`` contains:

.. include:: demopkg1/__init__.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The :command:`print` statements shows the search path before and after
it is modified, to highlight the difference.

And an ``extension`` directory, with add-on features for
:mod:`demopkg`, contains

::

    $ find extension -name '*.py'
    extension/__init__.py
    extension/demopkg1/__init__.py
    extension/demopkg1/not_shared.py

A simple test program imports the :mod:`demopkg1` package:

.. include:: pkgutil_extend_path.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

When this test program is run directly from the command line, the
:mod:`not_shared` module is not found.  

.. note::

  The full filesystem paths in these examples have been shortened to
  emphasize the parts that change.

::

	$ python pkgutil_extend_path.py

	demopkg1.__path__ before:
	['.../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1']
	
	demopkg1.__path__ after:
	['.../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1']
	
	demopkg1           : .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1/__init__.py
	demopkg1.shared    : .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1/shared.py
	demopkg1.not_shared: Not found (No module named not_shared)

However, if the ``extension`` directory is added to the
:data:`PYTHONPATH` and the program is run again, different results are
produced.

::

    $ export PYTHONPATH=extension
    $ python pkgutil_extend_path.py
    demopkg1.__path__ before:
    ['.../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1']

    demopkg1.__path__ after:
    ['.../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1',
     '.../PyMOTW/pkgutil/extension/demopkg1']

    demopkg1           : .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1/__init__.pyc
    demopkg1.shared    : .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1/shared.pyc
    demopkg1.not_shared: .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/extension/demopkg1/not_shared.py

The version of :mod:`demopkg1` inside the ``extension`` directory has
been added to the search path, so the :mod:`not_shared` module is
found there.

Extending the path in this manner is useful for combining
platform-specific versions of packages with common packages,
especially if the platform-specific versions include C extension
modules.

Development Versions of Packages
--------------------------------

While develop enhancements to a project, it is common to need to test
changes to an installed package. Replacing the installed copy with a
development version may be a bad idea, since it is not necessarily
correct and other tools on the system are likely to depend on the
installed package. 

A completely separate copy of the package could be configured in a
development environment using `virtualenv`_, but for small
modifications the overhead of setting up a virtual environment with
all of the dependencies may be excessive.

Another option is to use :mod:`pkgutil` to modify the module search
path for modules that belong to the package under development. In this
case, however, the path must be reversed so development version
overrides the installed version.

Given a package :mod:`demopkg2` like this:

::

    $ find demopkg2 -name '*.py'
    demopkg2/__init__.py
    demopkg2/overloaded.py

With the function under development located in
``demopkg2/overloaded.py``. The installed version contains

.. include:: demopkg2/overloaded.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

and ``demopkg2/__init__.py`` contains

.. include:: demopkg2/__init__.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

:func:`reverse` is used to ensure that any directories added to the
search path by :mod:`pkgutil` are scanned for imports *before* the
default location.

This program imports :mod:`demopkg2.overloaded` and calls :func:`func`:

.. include:: pkgutil_devel.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Running it without any special path treatment produces output from the
installed version of :func:`func`.

::

    $ python pkgutil_devel.py
    demopkg2           : .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg2/__init__.py
    demopkg2.overloaded: .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg2/overloaded.py

A development directory containing

::

    $ find develop -name '*.py'
    develop/demopkg2/__init__.py
    develop/demopkg2/overloaded.py

and a modified version of :mod:`overloaded`

.. include:: develop/demopkg2/overloaded.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

will be loaded when the test program is run with the ``develop``
directory in the search path.

::

    $ export PYTHONPATH=develop 
    $ python pkgutil_devel.py

    demopkg2           : .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg2/__init__.pyc
    demopkg2.overloaded: .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/develop/demopkg2/overloaded.pyc


Managing Paths with PKG Files
-----------------------------

The first example above illustrated how to extend the search path
using extra directories included in the :data:`PYTHONPATH`. It is also
possible to add to the search path using ``*.pkg`` files containing
directory names. PKG files are similar to the PTH files used by the
:mod:`site` module. They can contain directory names, one per line, to
be added to the search path for the package.

Another way to structure the platform-specific portions of the
application from the first example is to use a separate directory for
each operating system, and include a ``.pkg`` file to extend the
search path.

This example uses the same :mod:`demopkg1` files, and also includes
the following files:

::

    $ find os_* -type f
    os_one/demopkg1/__init__.py
    os_one/demopkg1/not_shared.py
    os_one/demopkg1.pkg
    os_two/demopkg1/__init__.py
    os_two/demopkg1/not_shared.py
    os_two/demopkg1.pkg

The PKG files are named ``demopkg1.pkg`` to match the package
being extended.  They both contain::

    demopkg

This demo program shows the version of the module being imported:

.. include:: pkgutil_os_specific.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

A simple run script can be used to switch between the two packages:

.. include:: with_os.sh
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

And when run with ``"one"`` or ``"two"`` as the arguments, the path is
adjusted appropriately:

::

    $ ./with_os.sh one
    PYTHONPATH=os_one

    demopkg1.__path__ before:
    ['.../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1']

    demopkg1.__path__ after:
    ['.../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1',
     '.../PyMOTW/pkgutil/os_one/demopkg1',
     'demopkg']

    demopkg1           : .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1/__init__.pyc
    demopkg1.shared    : .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1/shared.pyc
    demopkg1.not_shared: .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/os_one/demopkg1/not_shared.pyc

::

    $ ./with_os.sh two
    PYTHONPATH=os_two

    demopkg1.__path__ before:
    ['.../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1']

    demopkg1.__path__ after:
    ['.../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1',
     '.../PyMOTW/pkgutil/os_two/demopkg1',
     'demopkg']

    demopkg1           : .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1/__init__.pyc
    demopkg1.shared    : .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/demopkg1/shared.pyc
    demopkg1.not_shared: .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/os_two/demopkg1/not_shared.pyc

PKG files can appear anywhere in the normal search path, so a
single PKG file in the current working directory could also be
used to include a development tree.

Nested Packages
---------------

For nested packages, it is only necessary to modify the path of the top-level
package. For example, with this directory structure

::

    $ find nested -name '*.py'
    nested/__init__.py
    nested/second/__init__.py
    nested/second/deep.py
    nested/shallow.py

Where ``nested/__init__.py`` contains

.. include:: nested/__init__.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

and a development tree like

::

    $ find develop/nested -name '*.py'
    develop/nested/__init__.py
    develop/nested/second/__init__.py
    develop/nested/second/deep.py
    develop/nested/shallow.py

Both the :mod:`shallow` and :mod:`deep` modules contain a simple
function to print out a message indicating whether or not they come
from the installed or development version.

This test program exercises the new packages.

.. include:: pkgutil_nested.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

When ``pkgutil_nested.py`` is run without any path manipulation, the
installed version of both modules are used.

::

    $ python pkgutil_nested.py
    nested.shallow: .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/nested/shallow.pyc
    This func() comes from the installed version of nested.shallow

    nested.second.deep: .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/nested/second/deep.pyc
    This func() comes from the installed version of nested.second.deep

When the ``develop`` directory is added to the path, the development
version of both functions override the installed versions.

::

    $ PYTHONPATH=develop python pkgutil_nested.py 
    nested.shallow: .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/develop/nested/shallow.pyc
    This func() comes from the development version of nested.shallow

    nested.second.deep: .../PyMOTW/pkgutil/develop/nested/second/deep.pyc
    This func() comes from the development version of nested.second.deep

Package Data
============

In addition to code, Python packages can contain data files such as
templates, default configuration files, images, and other supporting
files used by the code in the package.  The :func:`get_data` function
gives access to the data in the files in a format-agnostic way, so it
does not matter if the package is distributed as an EGG, part of a
frozen binary, or regular files on the filesystem.

With a package :mod:`pkgwithdata` containing a ``templates`` directory

::

    $ find pkgwithdata -type f
    
    pkgwithdata/__init__.py
    pkgwithdata/templates/base.html

and ``pkgwithdata/templates/base.html`` containing

.. literalinclude:: pkgwithdata/templates/base.html

This program uses :func:`get_data` to retrieve the template contents
and print them out.

.. include:: pkgutil_get_data.py
   :literal:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The arguments to :func:`get_data` are the dotted name of the package,
and a filename relative to the top of the package.  The return value
is a byte sequence, so it is encoded as UTF-8 before being printed.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'pkgutil_get_data.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python pkgutil_get_data.py

	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN">
	<html> <head>
	<title>PyMOTW Template</title>
	</head>
	
	<body>
	<h1>Example Template</h1>
	
	<p>This is a sample data file.</p>
	
	</body>
	</html>

.. {{{end}}}

:func:`get_data` is distribution format-agnostic because it uses the
import hooks defined in :pep:`302` to access the package contents.
Any loader that provides the hooks can be used, including the ZIP
archive importer in :mod:`zipfile`.

.. include:: pkgutil_get_data_zip.py
   :literal:
   :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example creates a ZIP archive with a copy of the
:mod:`pkgwithdata` package, including a renamed version of the
template file.  It then adds the ZIP archive to the import path before
using :mod:`pkgutil` to load the template and print it.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'pkgutil_get_data_zip.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python pkgutil_get_data_zip.py

	Loading pkgwithdata from pkgwithdatainzip.zip/pkgwithdata/__init__.pyc
	
	Template:
	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN">
	<html> <head>
	<title>PyMOTW Template</title>
	</head>
	
	<body>
	<h1>Example Template</h1>
	
	<p>This is a sample data file.</p>
	
	</body>
	</html>
