About Python Module of the Week
===============================

PyMOTW is a series of blog posts written by `Doug Hellmann
<http://www.doughellmann.com/>`_.  It was started as a way to build
the habit of writing something on a regular basis.  The focus of the
series is building a set of example code for the modules in the
`Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ standard library.

See the project home page at http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/ for
updates and the latest release.  Source code is available from
http://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/pymotw/.

Complete documentation for the standard library can be found on the
Python web site at http://docs.python.org/library/.

Tools
=====

The source text for PyMOTW is `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ and the HTML and PDF output are
created using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.

As new articles are written, they are posted to my blog

.. _motw-cli:

The motw Command Line Interface
===============================

PyMOTW includes a command line program, ``motw``, to make it even
easier to access the examples while you are developing. Simply run
``motw module`` to open the local copy of the HTML text for the named
module. There are also options to view the articles in different
formats (see the ``-h`` output for details).

Usage: ``motw [options] <module_name>``

Options:

-h, --help  show this help message and exit
-t, --text  Print plain-text version of help to stdout
-w, --web   Open HTML version of help from web
--html      Open HTML version of help from installed file

.. _motw-interactive:

Using PyMOTW with the Interactive Interpreter
=============================================

PyMOTW articles are at your fingertips while you're working with the
Python interactive interpreter.  Importing ``PyMOTW`` adds the
function ``motw()`` to the ``__builtins__`` namespace.  Run
``motw(module)`` to see the help for an imported module.  Enclose the
name in quotes for a module that you haven't already imported.

Translations and Other Versions
===============================

`Chinese <http://www.vbarter.cn/pymotw/>`_

  Junjie Cai (蔡俊杰) and Yan Sheng (盛艳) have started a google code
  project called PyMOTWCN (http://code.google.com/p/pymotwcn/) and
  posted the completed translations at http://www.vbarter.cn/pymotw/.

`German <http://schoenian-online.de/pymotw.html>`_

  Ralf Schönian is translating PyMOTW into German, following an
  alphabetical order.  The results are available on his web site,
  http://schoenian-online.de/pymotw.html.  Ralf is an active member of
  the `pyCologne
  <http://wiki.python.de/User_Group_K%C3%B6ln?action=show&redirect=pyCologne>`_
  user group in Germany and author of pyVoc, the open source
  English/German vocabulary trainer (http://code.google.com/p/pyvoc/).

`Italian <http://robyp.x10hosting.com/>`_

  Roberto Pauletto is working on an Italian translation at
  http://robyp.x10hosting.com/.  Roberto creates Windows applications
  with C# by day, and tinkers with Linux and Python at home.  He has
  recently moved to Python from Perl for all of his
  system-administration scripting.

`Spanish <http://denklab.org/articles/category/pymotw/>`_

  `Ernesto Rico Schmidt <http://denklab.org/>`_ provides a Spanish
  translation that follows the English version posts. Ernesto is in
  Bolivia, and is translating these examples as a way to contribute to
  the members of the `Bolivian Free Software
  <http://www.softwarelibre.org.bo/>`_ community who use Python.  The
  full list of articles available in Spanish can be found at
  http://denklab.org/articles/category/pymotw/, and there is an `RSS
  feed <http://denklab.org/feeds/articles/category/pymotw/>`_.

`Japanese <http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW-ja/>`_

  `Tetsuya Morimoto <http://d.hatena.ne.jp/t2y-1979/>`_ is creating a
  Japanese translation. Tetsuya has used Python for 1.5 years. He has
  as experience at a Linux Distributor using Python with yum,
  anaconda, and rpm-tools while building RPM packages. Now, he uses it
  to make useful tools for himself, and is interested in application
  frameworks such as Django, mercurial and wxPython. Tetsuya is a
  member of `Python Japan User's Group <http://www.python.jp/Zope/>`_
  and `Python Code Reading
  <http://groups.google.co.jp/group/python-code-reading>`_. The home
  page for his translation is http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW-ja/.


Compendiums
-----------

Gerard Flanagan is working on a "Python compendium" called `The Hazel
Tree <http://www.thehazeltree.org/>`_.  He is converting a collection
of old and new of Python-related reference material into
reStructuredText and then building a single searchable repository from
the results.  I am very pleased to have PyMOTW included with works
from authors like Mark Pilgrim, Fredrik Lundh, Andrew Kuchling, and a
growing list of others.
