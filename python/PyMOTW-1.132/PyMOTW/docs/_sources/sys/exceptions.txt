Exception Handling
==================

:mod:`sys` includes features for trapping and working with exceptions.

Unhandled Exceptions
====================

Many applications are structured with a main loop that wraps execution
in a global exception handler to trap errors not handled at a lower
level.  Another way to achieve the same thing is by setting the
:data:`sys.excepthook` to a function that takes three arguments (error
type, error value, and traceback) and let it deal with unhandled
errors.

.. include:: sys_excepthook.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Since there is no :command:`try:except` block around the line where
the exception is raised the following :command:`print` statement is
not run, even though the except hook is set.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'sys_excepthook.py', ignore_error=True))
.. }}}

::

	$ python sys_excepthook.py

	Before exception
	Unhandled error: <type 'exceptions.RuntimeError'> This is the error message

.. {{{end}}}

Current Exception
=================

There are times when an explicit exception handler is preferred,
either for code clarity or to avoid conflicts with libraries that try
to install their own excepthook.  In these cases you may want to write
a common handler function, but avoid passing the exception object to
it explicitly.  You can get the current exception for a thread by
calling :func:`exc_info`.

The return value of :func:`exc_info` is a three member tuple
containing the exception class, an exception instance, and a
traceback.  Using :func:`exc_info` is preferred over the old form
(with :const:`exc_type`, :const:`exc_value`, and
:const:`exc_traceback`) because it is thread-safe.

.. include:: sys_exc_info.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This example avoids introducing a circular reference between the
traceback object and a local variable in the current frame by ignoring
that part of the return value from :func:`exc_info`.  If the traceback
is needed (e.g., so it can be logged), explicitly delete the local
variable (using :command:`del`) to avoid cycles.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'sys_exc_info.py'))
.. }}}

	$ python sys_exc_info.py

	Handling RuntimeError exception with message "This is the error message" in Thread-2
	Handling RuntimeError exception with message "This is the error message" in Thread-1

.. {{{end}}}

Previous Interactive Exception
==============================

In the interactive interpreter, there is only one thread of
interaction.  Unhandled exceptions in that thread are saved to three
variables in :mod:`sys` (:const:`last_type`, :const:`last_value`, and
:const:`last_traceback`) to make it easy to retrieve them for
debugging.  Using the post-mortem debugger in :mod:`pdb` avoids any
need to use the values directly.
