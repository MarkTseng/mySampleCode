mailbox -- Access and manipulate email archives
===============================================

.. module:: mailbox
    :synopsis: Access and manipulate email archives.

:Purpose: Work with email messages in various local file formats.
:Python Version: 1.4 and later

The :mod:`mailbox` module defines a common API for accessing email
messages stored in local disk formats, including:

- Maildir
- mbox
- MH
- Babyl
- MMDF

There are base classes for :class:`Mailbox` and :class:`Message`, and
each mailbox format includes a corresponding pair of subclasses to
implement the details for that format.

mbox
====

The mbox format is the simplest to illustrate in documentation, since
it is entirely plain text.  Each mailbox is stored as a single file,
with all of the messages concatenated together.  Each time a line
starting with "From " (``From`` followed by a single space) is
encountered it is treated as the beginning of a new message.  Any time
those characters appear at the beginning of a line in the message
body, they are escaped by prefixing the line with "``>``".

Creating an mbox mailbox
------------------------

Instantiate the ``email.mbox`` class by passing the filename to the
constructor.  If the file does not exist, it is created when you add
messages to it using ``add()``.

.. include:: mailbox_mbox_create.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The result of this script is a new mailbox file with 2 email messages.

.. {{{cog
.. from paver.path import path
.. (path(cog.inFile).dirname() / 'example.mbox').unlink()
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'mailbox_mbox_create.py'))
.. }}}

	This is the second body.
	

.. {{{end}}}

Reading an mbox Mailbox
-----------------------

To read an existing mailbox, open it and treat the mbox object like a
dictionary.  They keys are arbitrary values defined by the mailbox
instance and are not necessary meaningful other than as internal
identifiers for message objects.

.. include:: mailbox_mbox_read.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

You can iterate over the open mailbox but notice that, unlike with
dictionaries, the default iterator for a mailbox works on the *values*
instead of the *keys*.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'mailbox_mbox_read.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python mailbox_mbox_read.py

	Sample message 1
	Sample message 2

.. {{{end}}}

Removing Messages from an mbox Mailbox
--------------------------------------

To remove an existing message from an mbox file, use its key with
``remove()`` or use ``del``.

.. include:: mailbox_mbox_remove.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Notice the use of ``lock()`` and ``unlock()`` to prevent issues from
simultaneous access to the file, and ``flush()`` to force the changes
to be written to disk.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'mailbox_mbox_remove.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python mailbox_mbox_remove.py

Maildir
=======

The Maildir format was created to eliminate the problem of concurrent
modification to an mbox file.  Instead of using a single file, the
mailbox is organized as directory where each message is contained in
its own file.  This also allows mailboxes to be nested, and so the API
for a Maildir mailbox is extended with methods to work with
sub-folders.

Creating a Maildir Mailbox
--------------------------

The only real difference between using a Maildir and mbox is that to
instantiate the ``email.Maildir`` object we need to pass the directory
containing the mailbox to the constructor.  As before, if it does not
exist, the mailbox is created when you add messages to it using
``add()``.

.. include:: mailbox_maildir_create.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Since we have added messages to the mailbox, they go to the "new"
subdirectory.  Once they are "read" a client could move them to the
"cur" subdirectory.

.. warning::
    Although it is safe to write to the same maildir from multiple
    processes, ``add()`` is not thread-safe, so make sure you use a
    semaphore or other locking device to prevent simultaneous
    modifications to the mailbox from multiple threads of the same
    process.

.. (path(cog.inFile).dirname() / 'Example').rmtree()

Reading a Maildir Mailbox
-------------------------

Reading from an existing Maildir mailbox works just like with mbox.

.. include:: mailbox_maildir_read.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Notice that the messages are not guaranteed to be read in any
particular order.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'mailbox_maildir_read.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python mailbox_maildir_read.py

	Sample message 2
	Sample message 1

.. {{{end}}}


Removing Messages from a Maildir Mailbox
----------------------------------------

To remove an existing message from a Maildir mailbox, use its key with
``remove()`` or use ``del``.

.. include:: mailbox_maildir_remove.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'mailbox_maildir_remove.py'))

Maildir folders
---------------

Subdirectories or *folders* of a Maildir mailbox can be managed
directly through the methods of the Maildir class.  Callers can list,
retrieve, create, and remove sub-folders for a given mailbox.

.. include:: mailbox_maildir_folders.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The directory name for the folder is constructed by prefixing the
folder name with ``.``.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'mailbox_maildir_folders.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python mailbox_maildir_folders.py

Other Formats
=============

MH is another multi-file mailbox format used by some mail handlers.
Babyl and MMDF are single-file formats with different message
separators than mbox.  None seem to be as popular as mbox or Maildir.
The single-file formats support the same API as mbox, and MH includes
the folder-related methods found in the Maildir class.
