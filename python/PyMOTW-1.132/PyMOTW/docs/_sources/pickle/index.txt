pickle and cPickle -- Python object serialization
=================================================

.. module:: pickle
    :synopsis: Python object serialization

.. module:: cPickle
    :synopsis: Python object serialization

:Purpose: Python object serialization
:Python Version: pickle at least 1.4, cPickle 1.5

The :mod:`pickle` module implements an algorithm for turning an
arbitrary Python object into a series of bytes.  This process is also
called *serializing*" the object. The byte stream representing the
object can then be transmitted or stored, and later reconstructed to
create a new object with the same characteristics.

The :mod:`cPickle` module implements the same algorithm, in C instead
of Python. It is many times faster than the Python implementation, but
does not allow the user to subclass from Pickle. If subclassing is not
important for your use, you probably want to use cPickle.

.. warning::

    The documentation for pickle makes clear that it offers no security
    guarantees. Be careful if you use pickle for inter-process communication or
    data storage.  Do not trust data you cannot verify as secure.

Importing
=========

It is common to first try to import cPickle, giving an alias of
"pickle". If that import fails for any reason, you can then fall back
on the native Python implementation in the pickle module. This gives
you the faster implementation, if it is available, and the portable
implementation otherwise.

::

    try:
       import cPickle as pickle
    except:
       import pickle

Encoding and Decoding Data in Strings
=====================================

This first example encodes a data structure as a string, then prints
the string to the console. It uses a data structure made up of
entirely native types. Instances of any class can be pickled, as will
be illustrated in a later example.  Use ``pickle.dumps()`` to create a
string representation of the value of the object.

.. include:: pickle_string.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

By default, the pickle will contain only ASCII characters. A more
efficient binary format is also available, but all of the examples
here use the ASCII output because it is easier to understand in print.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'pickle_string.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python pickle_string.py

	DATA:[{'a': 'A', 'b': 2, 'c': 3.0}]
	PICKLE: (lp1
	(dp2
	S'a'
	S'A'
	sS'c'
	F3
	sS'b'
	I2
	sa.

.. {{{end}}}

Once the data is serialized, you can write it to a file, socket, pipe, etc.
Then later you can read the file and unpickle the data to construct a new
object with the same values.

.. include:: pickle_unpickle.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

As you see, the newly constructed object is the equal to but not the same
object as the original. No surprise there.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'pickle_unpickle.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python pickle_unpickle.py

	BEFORE:[{'a': 'A', 'b': 2, 'c': 3.0}]
	AFTER:[{'a': 'A', 'b': 2, 'c': 3.0}]
	SAME?: False
	EQUAL?: True

.. {{{end}}}


Working with Streams
====================

In addition to ``dumps()`` and ``loads()``, pickle provides a couple
of convenience functions for working with file-like streams. It is
possible to write multiple objects to a stream, and then read them
from the stream without knowing in advance how many objects are
written or how big they are.

.. include:: pickle_stream.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header


The example simulates streams using StringIO buffers, so we have to
play a little trickery to establish the readable stream. A simple
database format could use pickles to store objects, too, though
:mod:`shelve` would be easier to work with.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'pickle_stream.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python pickle_stream.py

	WRITING: pickle (elkcip)
	WRITING: cPickle (elkciPc)
	WRITING: last (tsal)
	READ: pickle (elkcip)
	READ: cPickle (elkciPc)
	READ: last (tsal)

.. {{{end}}}

Besides storing data, pickles are very handy for inter-process
communication. For example, using ``os.fork()`` and ``os.pipe()``, one
can establish worker processes that read job instructions from one
pipe and write the results to another pipe. The core code for managing
the worker pool and sending jobs in and receiving responses can be
reused, since the job and response objects don't have to be of a
particular class. If you are using pipes or sockets, do not forget to
flush after dumping each object, to push the data through the
connection to the other end.  See :mod:`multiprocessing` if you don't
want to write your own worker pool manager.


Problems Reconstructing Objects
===============================

When working with your own classes, you must ensure that the class being
pickled appears in the namespace of the process reading the pickle. Only the
data for the instance is pickled, not the class definition. The class name is
used to find the constructor to create the new object when unpickling. Take
this example, which writes instances of a class to a file:

.. include:: pickle_dump_to_file_1.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header


When run, the script creates a file based on the name given as
argument on the command line:

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'pickle_dump_to_file_1.py test.dat'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python pickle_dump_to_file_1.py test.dat

	WRITING: pickle (elkcip)
	WRITING: cPickle (elkciPc)
	WRITING: last (tsal)

.. {{{end}}}

A simplistic attempt to load the resulting pickled objects fails:

.. include:: pickle_load_from_file_1.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

This version fails because there is no SimpleObject class available:

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'pickle_load_from_file_1.py test.dat', ignore_error=True))
.. }}}

::

	$ python pickle_load_from_file_1.py test.dat

	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "pickle_load_from_file_1.py", line 52, in <module>
	    o = pickle.load(in_s)
	AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'SimpleObject'

.. {{{end}}}

The corrected version, which imports SimpleObject from the original
script, succeeds.

Add:

::

    from pickle_dump_to_file_1 import SimpleObject

to the end of the import list, then re-run the script:

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'pickle_load_from_file_2.py test.dat'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python pickle_load_from_file_2.py test.dat

	READ: pickle (elkcip)
	READ: cPickle (elkciPc)
	READ: last (tsal)

.. {{{end}}}

There are some special considerations when pickling data types with
values that cannot be pickled (sockets, file handles, database
connections, etc.). Classes that use values which cannot be pickled
can define ``__getstate__()`` and ``__setstate__()`` to return a
subset of the state of the instance to be pickled. New-style classes
can also define ``__getnewargs__()``, which should return arguments to
be passed to the class memory allocator (``C.__new__()``).  Use of
these features is covered in more detail in the standard library
documentation.

Circular References
===================

The pickle protocol automatically handles circular references between
objects, so you don't need to do anything special with complex data
structures.  Consider the digraph:

.. digraph:: pickle_example

   "root";
   "root" -> "a";
   "root" -> "b";
   "a" -> "b";
   "b" -> "a";
   "b" -> "c";
   "a" -> "a";

Even though the graph includes several cycles, the correct structure
can be pickled and then reloaded.

.. include:: pickle_cycle.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The reloaded nodes are not the same object, but the relationship
between the nodes is maintained and only one copy of the object with
multiple reference is reloaded. Both of these statements can be
verified by examining the ``id()`` values for the nodes before and
after being passed through pickle.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'pickle_cycle.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python pickle_cycle.py

	ORIGINAL GRAPH:
	 root ->  a (4299677584)
	    a ->  b (4299677648)
	    b ->  a (4299677584)
	    b ->  c (4299718736)
	    a ->  a (4299677584)
	 root ->  b (4299677648)
	
	RELOADED GRAPH:
	 root ->  a (4299718864)
	    a ->  b (4299718928)
	    b ->  a (4299718864)
	    b ->  c (4299718992)
	    a ->  a (4299718864)
	 root ->  b (4299718928)

.. {{{end}}}
