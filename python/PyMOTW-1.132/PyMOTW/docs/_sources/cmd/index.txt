cmd -- Create line-oriented command processors
==============================================

.. module:: cmd
    :synopsis: Create line-oriented command processors.

:Purpose: Create line-oriented command processors.
:Python Version: 1.4 and later, with some additions in 2.3

The :mod:`cmd` module contains one public class, :class:`Cmd`,
designed to be used as a base class for command processors such as
interactive shells and other command interpreters. By default it uses
:mod:`readline` for interactive prompt handling, command line editing,
and command completion.

Processing Commands
===================

The interpreter uses a loop to read all lines from its input, parse
them, and then dispatch the command to an appropriate command
handler. Input lines are parsed into two parts. The command, and any
other text on the line. If the user enters a command ``foo bar``, and
your class includes a method named :func:`do_foo()`, it is called with
``"bar"`` as the only argument.

The end-of-file marker is dispatched to :func:`do_EOF()`. If a command
handler returns a true value, the program will exit cleanly. So to
give a clean way to exit your interpreter, make sure to implement
:func:`do_EOF()` and have it return True.

This simple example program supports the "greet" command:

.. include:: cmd_simple.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

By running it interactively, we can demonstrate how commands are dispatched as
well as show of some of the features included in :class:`Cmd` for free.

::

    $ python cmd_simple.py 
    (Cmd) 

The first thing to notice is the command prompt, ``(Cmd)``. The
prompt can be configured through the attribute prompt. If the prompt
changes as the result of a command processor, the new value is used to
query for the next command.

::

    (Cmd) help

    Undocumented commands:
    ======================
    EOF  greet  help

The ``help`` command is built into :class:`Cmd`. With no arguments, it
shows the list of commands available. If you include a command you
want help on, the output is more verbose and restricted to details of
that command, when available.

If we use the greet command, :func:`do_greet()` is invoked to handle it:

::

    (Cmd) greet
    hello

If your class does not include a specific command processor for a
command, the method :func:`default()` is called with the entire input
line as an argument. The built-in implementation of :func:`default()`
reports an error.

::

    (Cmd) foo *** Unknown syntax: foo

Since :func:`do_EOF()` returns True, typing Ctrl-D will drop us out of
the interpreter.

::

    (Cmd) ^D$ 

Notice that no newline is printed, so the results are a little messy.

Command Arguments
=================

This version of the example includes a few enhancements to eliminate some of
the annoyances and add help for the greet command. 

.. include:: cmd_arguments.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

First, let's look at the help. The docstring added to
:func:`do_greet()` becomes the help text for the command:

::

    $ python cmd_arguments.py 
    (Cmd) help

    Documented commands (type help ):
    ========================================
    greet

    Undocumented commands:
    ======================
    EOF  help

    (Cmd) help greet
    greet [person]
            Greet the named person

The output shows one optional argument to the greet command,
*person*. Although the argument is optional to the command, there is a
distinction between the command and the callback method. The method
always takes the argument, but sometimes the value is an empty
string. It is left up to the command processor to determine if an
empty argument is valid, or do any further parsing and processing of
the command. In this example, if a person's name is provided then the
greeting is personalized.

::

    (Cmd) greet Alice
    hi, Alice
    (Cmd) greet
    hi

Whether an argument is given by the user or not, the value passed to the
command processor does not include the command itself. That simplifies parsing
in the command processor, if multiple arguments are needed.

Live Help
=========

In the previous example, the formatting of the help text leaves
something to be desired. Since it comes from the docstring, it retains
the indentation from our source. We could edit the source to remove
the extra white-space, but that would leave our application looking
poorly formatted. An alternative solution is to implement a help
handler for the greet command, named :func:`help_greet()`. When
present, the help handler is called on to produce help text for the
named command.

.. include:: cmd_do_help.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

In this simple example, the text is static but formatted more nicely. It would
also be possible to use previous command state to tailor the contents of the
help text to the current context.

::

    $ python cmd_do_help.py 
    (Cmd) help greet
    greet [person]
    Greet the named person

It is up to the help handler to actually output the help message, and not
simply return the help text for handling elsewhere.

Auto-Completion
===============

:class:`Cmd` includes support for command completion based on the
names of the commands with processor methods. The user triggers
completion by hitting the tab key at an input prompt. When multiple
completions are possible, pressing tab twice prints a list of the
options.

::

    $ python cmd_do_help.py 
    (Cmd) <tab><tab>
    EOF    greet  help   
    (Cmd) h<tab>
    (Cmd) help

Once the command is known, argument completion is handled by methods with the
prefix ``complete_``. This allows you to assemble a list of possible completions
using your own criteria (query a database, look at at a file or directory on
the filesystem, etc.). In this case, the program has a hard-coded set of
"friends" who receive a less formal greeting than named or anonymous
strangers. A real program would probably save the list somewhere, and either
read it once and cache the contents to be scanned as needed.

.. include:: cmd_arg_completion.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

When there is input text, :func:`complete_greet()` returns a list of
friends that match. Otherwise, the full list of friends is returned.

::

    $ python cmd_arg_completion.py 
    (Cmd) greet <tab><tab>
    Adam     Alice    Barbara  Bob      
    (Cmd) greet A<tab><tab>
    Adam   Alice  
    (Cmd) greet Ad<tab>
    (Cmd) greet Adam
    hi, Adam!

If the name given is not in the list of friends, the formal greeting is given.

::

    (Cmd) greet Joe
    hello, Joe

Overriding Base Class Methods
=============================

Cmd includes several methods that can be overridden as hooks for taking
actions or altering the base class behavior. This example is not exhaustive,
but contains many of the methods commonly useful.

.. include:: cmd_illustrate_methods.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

:func:`cmdloop()` is the main processing loop of the interpreter. You
can override it, but it is usually not necessary, since the
:func:`preloop()` and :func:`postloop()` hooks are available.

Each iteration through :func:`cmdloop()` calls :func:`onecmd()` to
dispatch the command to its processor. The actual input line is parsed
with :func:`parseline()` to create a tuple containing the command, and
the remaining portion of the line.

If the line is empty, :func:`emptyline()` is called. The default
implementation runs the previous command again. If the line contains a
command, first :func:`precmd()` is called then the processor is looked
up and invoked. If none is found, :func:`default()` is called
instead. Finally postcmd() is called.

Here's an example session with ``print`` statements added:

::

    $ python cmd_illustrate_methods.py 
    cmdloop(Illustrating the methods of cmd.Cmd)
    preloop()
    Illustrating the methods of cmd.Cmd
    (Cmd) greet Bob
    precmd(greet Bob)
    onecmd(greet Bob)
    parseline(greet Bob) => ('greet', 'Bob', 'greet Bob')
    hello, Bob
    postcmd(None, greet Bob)
    (Cmd) ^Dprecmd(EOF)
    onecmd(EOF)
    parseline(EOF) => ('EOF', '', 'EOF')
    postcmd(True, EOF)
    postloop()


Configuring Cmd Through Attributes
==================================

In addition to the methods described above, there are several attributes for
controlling command interpreters.

``prompt`` can be set to a string to be printed each time the user is asked for a
new command.

``intro`` is the "welcome" message printed at the start of the program. cmdloop()
takes an argument for this value, or you can set it on the class directly.

When printing help, the ``doc_header``, ``misc_header``,
``undoc_header``, and ``ruler`` attributes are used to format the
output.

This example class shows a command processor to let the user control the
prompt for the interactive session.

.. include:: cmd_attributes.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

::

    $ python cmd_attributes.py 
    Simple command processor example.
    prompt: prompt hello
    hello: help

    doc_header
    ----------
    prompt

    undoc_header
    ------------
    EOF  help

    hello: 


Shelling Out
============

To supplement the standard command processing, :class:`Cmd` includes 2
special command prefixes. A question mark (``?``) is equivalent to the
built-in help command, and can be used in the same way. An exclamation
point (``!``) maps to :func:`do_shell()`, and is intended for shelling
out to run other commands, as in this example.

.. include:: cmd_do_shell.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

::

    $ python cmd_do_shell.py 
    (Cmd) ?

    Documented commands (type help ):
    ========================================
    echo  shell

    Undocumented commands:
    ======================
    EOF  help

    (Cmd) ? shell
    Run a shell command
    (Cmd) ? echo
    Print the input, replacing '$out' with the output of the last shell command
    (Cmd) shell pwd
    running shell command: pwd
    /Users/dhellmann/Documents/PyMOTW/in_progress/cmd

    (Cmd) ! pwd
    running shell command: pwd
    /Users/dhellmann/Documents/PyMOTW/in_progress/cmd

    (Cmd) echo $out
    /Users/dhellmann/Documents/PyMOTW/in_progress/cmd

    (Cmd) 


Alternative Inputs
==================

While the default mode for :func:`Cmd` is to interact with the user
through the :mod:`readline` library, it is also possible to pass a
series of commands in to standard input using standard Unix shell
redirection.

::

    $ echo help | python cmd_do_help.py 
    (Cmd) 
    Documented commands (type help ):
    ========================================
    greet

    Undocumented commands:
    ======================
    EOF  help

    (Cmd) 

If you would rather have your program read the script file directly, a
few other changes may be needed. Since :mod:`readline` interacts with
the terminal/tty device, rather than the standard input stream, you
should disable it if you know your script is going to be reading from
a file. Also, to avoid printing superfluous prompts, you can set the
prompt to an empty string. This example shows how to open a file and
pass it as input to a modified version of the HelloWorld example.

.. include:: cmd_file.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

With *use_rawinput* set to False and *prompt* set to an empty string,
we can call the script on this input file:

.. include:: cmd_file.txt
    :literal:

to produce output like:

::

    $ python cmd_file.py cmd_file.txt 
    hello, 
    hello, Alice and Bob

Commands from sys.argv
======================

You can also process command line arguments to the program as a
command for your interpreter class, instead of reading commands from
stdin or a file.  To use the command line arguments, you can call
:func:`onecmd()` directly, as in this example.

.. include:: cmd_argv.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Since :func:`onecmd()` takes a single string as input, the arguments
to the program need to be joined together before being passed in.

::

    $ python cmd_argv.py greet Command Line User
    hello, Command Line User
    $ python cmd_argv.py
    (Cmd) greet Interactive User
    hello, Interactive User
    (Cmd)
