Tracing a Program As It Runs
===============================

There are two ways to inject code to watch a program run: *tracing*
and *profiling*.  They are similar, but intended for different
purposes and so have different constraints.  The easiest, but least
efficient, way to monitor a program is through a *trace hook*, which
can be used for writing a debugger, code coverage monitoring, or many
other purposes.

The trace hook is modified by passing a callback function to
:func:`sys.settrace`.  The callback will receive three arguments,
frame (the stack frame from the code being run), event (a string
naming the type of notification), and arg (an event-specific value).
There are 7 event types for different levels of information that occur
as a program is being executed.

+-------------------+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Event             | When                                | arg value                                |
+===================+=====================================+==========================================+
| ``'call'``        | Before a function is executed.      | ``None``                                 |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``'line'``        | Before a line is executed.          | ``None``                                 |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``'return'``      | Before a function returns.          | The value being returned.                |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``'exception'``   | After an exception occurs.          | The (exception, value, traceback) tuple. |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``'c_call'``      | Before a C function is called.      | The C function object.                   |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``'c_return'``    | After a C function returns.         | ``None``                                 |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| ``'c_exception'`` | After a C function throws an error. | ``None``                                 |
+-------------------+-------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+

Tracing Function Calls
======================

A ``call`` event is generated before every function call.  The frame
passed to the callback can be used to find out which function is being
called and from where.

.. literalinclude:: sys_settrace_call.py
    :linenos:

This example ignores calls to :func:`write`, as used by :command:`print` to
write to :const:`sys.stdout`.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'sys_settrace_call.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python sys_settrace_call.py

	Call to a on line 27 of sys_settrace_call.py from line 32 of sys_settrace_call.py
	in a()
	Call to b on line 24 of sys_settrace_call.py from line 29 of sys_settrace_call.py
	in b()

.. {{{end}}}

Tracing Inside Functions
========================

The trace hook can return a new hook to be used inside the new scope
(the *local* trace function). It is possible, for instance, to control
tracing to only run line-by-line within certain modules or functions.

.. literalinclude:: sys_settrace_line.py
    :linenos:

Here the global list of functions is kept in the variable
:cont:`TRACE_INTO`, so when :func:`trace_calls` runs it can return
:func:`trace_lines` to enable tracing inside of :func:`b`.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'sys_settrace_line.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python sys_settrace_line.py

	Call to a on line 40 of sys_settrace_line.py
	Call to b on line 35 of sys_settrace_line.py
	  b line 36
	  b line 37
	Call to c on line 31 of sys_settrace_line.py
	input = 10
	Leaving c()
	  b line 38
	Leaving b()
	Leaving a()

.. {{{end}}}


Watching the Stack
==================

Another useful way to use the hooks is to keep up with which functions
are being called, and what their return values are.  To monitor return
values, watch for the ``return`` event.

.. literalinclude:: sys_settrace_return.py
    :linenos:

The local trace function is used for watching returns, so
:func:`trace_calls_and_returns` needs to return a reference to itself
when a function is called, so the return value can be monitored.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'sys_settrace_return.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python sys_settrace_return.py

	Call to a on line 25 of sys_settrace_return.py
	in a()
	Call to b on line 21 of sys_settrace_return.py
	in b()
	b => response_from_b 
	a => response_from_b response_from_b 

.. {{{end}}}


Exception Propagation
=====================

Exceptions can be monitored by looking for the ``exception`` event in
a local trace function.  When an exception occurs, the trace hook is
called with a tuple containing the type of exception, the exception
object, and a traceback object.

.. literalinclude:: sys_settrace_exception.py
    :linenos:

Take care to limit where the local function is applied because some of
the internals of formatting error messages generate, and ignore, their
own exceptions.  **Every** exception is seen by the trace hook,
whether the caller catches and ignores it or not.


.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'sys_settrace_exception.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python sys_settrace_exception.py

	Tracing exception: RuntimeError "generating exception in c()" on line 26 of c
	Tracing exception: RuntimeError "generating exception in c()" on line 29 of b
	Tracing exception: RuntimeError "generating exception in c()" on line 33 of a
	Exception handler: generating exception in c()

.. {{{end}}}
