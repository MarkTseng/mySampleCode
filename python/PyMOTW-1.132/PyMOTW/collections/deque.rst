=======
 Deque
=======

A double-ended queue, or :class:`deque`, supports adding and removing
elements from either end. The more commonly used stacks and queues are
degenerate forms of deques, where the inputs and outputs are
restricted to a single end.

.. include:: collections_deque.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Since deques are a type of sequence container, they support some of
the same operations that lists support, such as examining the contents
with :func:`__getitem__`, determining length, and removing elements
from the middle by matching identity.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'collections_deque.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python collections_deque.py

	Deque: deque(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'])
	Length: 7
	Left end: a
	Right end: g
	remove(c): deque(['a', 'b', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'])

.. {{{end}}}

Populating
==========

A deque can be populated from either end, termed "left" and "right" in the
Python implementation.

.. include:: collections_deque_populating.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Notice that :func:`extendleft` iterates over its input and performs
the equivalent of an :func:`appendleft` for each item. The end result
is the :class:`deque` contains the input sequence in reverse order.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'collections_deque_populating.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python collections_deque_populating.py

	extend    : deque(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'])
	append    : deque(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h'])
	extendleft: deque(['g', 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'])
	appendleft: deque(['h', 'g', 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a'])

.. {{{end}}}

Consuming
=========

Similarly, the elements of the :class:`deque` can be consumed from
both or either end, depending on the algorithm being applied.

.. include:: collections_deque_consuming.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Use :func:`pop` to remove an item from the "right" end of the
:class:`deque` and :func:`popleft` to take from the "left" end.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'collections_deque_consuming.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python collections_deque_consuming.py

	From the right:
	g
	f
	e
	d
	c
	b
	a
	
	From the left:
	a
	b
	c
	d
	e
	f
	g

.. {{{end}}}


Since deques are thread-safe, the contents can even be consumed from
both ends at the same time from separate threads.

.. include:: collections_deque_both_ends.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The threads in this example alternate between each end, removing items
until the :class:`deque` is empty.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'collections_deque_both_ends.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python collections_deque_both_ends.py

	    Left: 0
	   Right: 10
	   Right: 9
	    Left: 1
	   Right: 8
	    Left: 2
	    Left: 3
	   Right: 7
	    Left: 4
	   Right: 6
	    Left: 5
	   Right done
	    Left done

.. {{{end}}}

Rotating
========

Another useful capability of the :class:`deque` is to rotate it in
either direction, to skip over some items.

.. include:: collections_deque_rotate.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Rotating the :class:`deque` to the right (using a positive rotation)
takes items from the right end and moves them to the left
end. Rotating to the left (with a negative value) takes items from the
left end and moves them to the right end.  It may help to visualize
the items in the deque as being engraved along the edge of a dial.

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'collections_deque_rotate.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python collections_deque_rotate.py

	Normal        : deque([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
	Right rotation: deque([8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
	Left rotation : deque([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1])
