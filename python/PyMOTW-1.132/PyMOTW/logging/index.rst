logging -- Report status, error, and informational messages.
============================================================

.. module:: logging
    :synopsis: Report status, error, and informational messages.

:Purpose: Report status, error, and informational messages.
:Python Version: 2.3

The :mod:`logging` module defines a standard API for reporting errors
and status information from applications and libraries. The key
benefit of having the logging API provided by a standard library
module is that all Python modules can participate in logging, so an
application's log can include messages from third-party modules.

Logging in Applications
=======================

There are two perspectives for examining logging.  Application
developers set up the :mod:`logging` module, directing the messages to
appropriate output channels.  It is possible to log messages with
different verbosity levels or to different destinations. Handlers for
writing log messages to files, HTTP GET/POST locations, email via
SMTP, generic sockets, or OS-specific logging mechanisms are all
included, and it is possible to create custom log destination classes
for special requirements not handled by any of the built-in classes.

Logging to a File
-----------------

Most applications are probably going to want to log to a file. Use the
:func:`basicConfig()` function to set up the default handler so that
debug messages are written to a file.

.. include:: logging_file_example.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

After running the script, the log message is written to
``logging_example.out``:

.. {{{cog
.. outfile = path(cog.inFile).parent / 'logging_example.out'
.. outfile.unlink()
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'logging_file_example.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python logging_file_example.py

	FILE:
	DEBUG:root:This message should go to the log file
	

.. {{{end}}}


Rotating Log Files
------------------

Running the script repeatedly causes more messages to be appended to
the file. To create a new file each time the program runs, pass a
``filemode`` argument to :func:`basicConfig()` with a value of
``'w'``. Rather than managing the creation of files this way, though,
it is simpler to use a :class:`RotatingFileHandler`:

.. include:: logging_rotatingfile_example.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

The result should be six separate files, each with part of the log
history for the application:

.. {{{cog
.. outfile = path(cog.inFile).parent / 'logging_rotatingfile_example.out'
.. deleted = [ f.unlink() for f in outfile.glob('*') ]
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'logging_rotatingfile_example.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python logging_rotatingfile_example.py

	logging_rotatingfile_example.out
	logging_rotatingfile_example.out.1
	logging_rotatingfile_example.out.2
	logging_rotatingfile_example.out.3
	logging_rotatingfile_example.out.4
	logging_rotatingfile_example.out.5

.. {{{end}}}

The most current file is always ``logging_rotatingfile_example.out``, and
each time it reaches the size limit it is renamed with the suffix ``.1``. Each of
the existing backup files is renamed to increment the suffix (``.1`` becomes ``.2``,
etc.) and the ``.5`` file is erased.

.. note::

  Obviously this example sets the log length much much too small as an
  extreme example. Set *maxBytes* to a more appropriate value in a
  real program.

Verbosity Levels
----------------

Another useful feature of the :mod:`logging` API is the ability to
produce different messages at different log levels. This code to be
instrumented with debug messages, for example, while setting the log
level down so that those debug messages are not written on a
production system.

========  =====
Level     Value
========  =====
CRITICAL  50
ERROR     40
WARNING   30
INFO      20
DEBUG     10
UNSET      0
========  =====

The logger, handler, and log message call each specify a level. The
log message is only emitted if the handler and logger are configured
to emit messages of that level or higher. For example, if a message is
:const:`CRITICAL`, and the logger is set to :const:`ERROR`, the
message is emitted (50 > 40). If a message is a :const:`WARNING`, and
the logger is set to produce only messages set to :const:`ERROR`, the
message is not emitted (30 < 40).

.. include:: logging_level_example.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

Run the script with an argument like 'debug' or 'warning' to see which
messages show up at different levels:

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'logging_level_example.py debug'))
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'logging_level_example.py info', include_prefix=False))
.. }}}

::

	$ python logging_level_example.py debug

	DEBUG:root:This is a debug message
	INFO:root:This is an info message
	WARNING:root:This is a warning message
	ERROR:root:This is an error message
	CRITICAL:root:This is a critical error message

	$ python logging_level_example.py info

	INFO:root:This is an info message
	WARNING:root:This is a warning message
	ERROR:root:This is an error message
	CRITICAL:root:This is a critical error message

.. {{{end}}}

Logging in Libraries
====================

Developers of libraries, rather than applications, should also use
:mod:`logging`.  For them, there is even less work to do.  Simply
create a logger instance for each context, using an appropriate name,
and then log messages using the stanard levels.  As long as a library
uses the logging API with consistent naming and level selections, the
application can be configured to show or hide messages from the
library, as desired.

Naming Logger Instances
-----------------------

All of the previous log messages all have 'root' embedded in them. The
:mod:`logging` module supports a hierarchy of loggers with different
names. An easy way to tell where a specific log message comes from is
to use a separate logger object for each module. Every new logger
inherits the configuration of its parent, and log messages sent to a
logger include the name of that logger. Optionally, each logger can be
configured differently, so that messages from different modules are
handled in different ways. Below is an example of how to log from
different modules so it is easy to trace the source of the message:

.. include:: logging_modules_example.py
    :literal:
    :start-after: #end_pymotw_header

And the output:

.. {{{cog
.. cog.out(run_script(cog.inFile, 'logging_modules_example.py'))
.. }}}

::

	$ python logging_modules_example.py

	WARNING:package1.module1:This message comes from one module
	WARNING:package2.module2:And this message comes from another module

.. {{{end}}}

There are many, many, more options for configuring logging, including
different log message formatting options, having messages delivered to
multiple destinations, and changing the configuration of a long-running
application on the fly using a socket interface. All of these options are
covered in depth in the library module documentation.
