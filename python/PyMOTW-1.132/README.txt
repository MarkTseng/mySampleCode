Python Module of the Week
=========================

PyMOTW is a series of blog posts written by `Doug Hellmann <http://www.doughellmann.com/>`_.  It was started as a way to build the habit of writing something on a regular basis.  The focus of the series is building a set of example code for the modules in the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ standard library.
