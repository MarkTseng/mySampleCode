Description: ========================================
         The Python Standard Library By Example
        ========================================
        
        This is the source code bundle for the book `The Python Standard
        Library By Example`_. It is an updated version of the source from the
        `Python Module of the Week`_ blog series by Doug Hellmann.
        
        The PyMOTW posts for Python 2 ended when I started working on the book
        in 2010. Now that the book is released, I am tagging the version of
        the source code from the book as "PyMOTW 2.0" and maintaining any
        fixes in the new ``py_stdlib_by_example`` repository on BitBucket.
