========================================
 The Python Standard Library By Example
========================================

This is the source code bundle for the book `The Python Standard
Library By Example`_. It is an updated version of the source from the
`Python Module of the Week`_ blog series by Doug Hellmann.

The PyMOTW posts for Python 2 ended when I started working on the book
in 2010. Now that the book is released, I am tagging the version of
the source code from the book as "PyMOTW 2.0" and maintaining any
fixes in the new ``py_stdlib_by_example`` repository on BitBucket.
