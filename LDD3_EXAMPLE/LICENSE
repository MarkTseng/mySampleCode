There are a few exception to this licence, however: a few sources
herein are distributed according to the GNU General Public License,
version 2. You'll find a copy of the license in
/usr/src/linux/COPYING, and in other places in your filesystem. The
affected source files are:

	pci/pci_skel.c
	tty/tiny_serial.c
	tty/tiny_tty.c
	usb/usb-skeleton.c

The files in ./pci ./tty and ./usb inherit the GPL from the kernel
sources, as most of their code comes straight from the kernel
(usb-skeleton.c being part of the kernel source tree directly.)
