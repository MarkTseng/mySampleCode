The "oops" program only deals with "Oops" messages generated on the PC
platform. I never got the time to extend it to the Alpha and the Sparc
(whose Oops messages actually give less information than the Intel one).
Nowadays there are many debugging tools available, and I don't feel like
this one is needed. If, on the other hand, you need such a best, feel
free to call me.
