Unless  otherwise stated, the  source code distributed  with this book
can   be  redistributed in source    or  binary form   so  long  as an
acknowledgment  appears in derived source   files. The citation should
list that the code comes from BOOK  by AUTHOR, published by O'Reilly &
Associates.  This  code is under copyright and  cannot be  included in
any other book, publication, or educational product without permission
from O'Reilly &  Associates. No warranty  is attached; we  cannot take

There are  a  few exception to  this  licence, however:  a few sources
herein    are  distributed  according   to   the  GNU   General Public
License. You'll find a copy  of the license in /usr/src/linux/COPYING,
and in other places in your filesystem. The affected source files are:

 	pci/pcidata.c
 	pci/pciregions.c
	misc-modules/allocator.c

The  files in ./pci inherit the   GPL from the kernel
sources, as  some of their code comes  straight from the kernel; their
being GPL'd doesn't  prevent you from writing  binary modules,  as the
code in the pci* modules isn't meant to be included in custom drivers,
the modules are just standalone probing tools.

The allocator,  on the other hand,  is completely mine, but I'd better
not allow hiding code dealing  with memory management.  If you want to
use  the  allocator  in a  binary-only module,   just compile it  as a
standalone module and distribute its source.



Note  that   although everything here  is  designed  to allow building
binary modules, I'm strongly against this practice. All software in my
opinion should be  free (in the  sense  of freedom). Every Linux  user
should acknowledge the importance of the GPL and should use it for any
new software.
