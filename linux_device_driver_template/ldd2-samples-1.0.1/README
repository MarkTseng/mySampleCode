These are the source files for the book "Linux Device Drivers".
This tree is version 1.0.1 for the second edition of the book.

All files include their license; most of them follow under these rules:

 Copyright (C) 2001 Alessandro Rubini and Jonathan Corbet
 Copyright (C) 2001 O'Reilly & Associates

 The source code in this file can be freely used, adapted,
 and redistributed in source or binary form, so long as an
 acknowledgment appears in derived source files.  The citation
 should list that the code comes from the book "Linux Device
 Drivers" by Alessandro Rubini and Jonathan Corbet, published
 by O'Reilly & Associates.   No warranty is attached;
 we cannot take responsibility for errors or fitness for use.


A few of the files, on the other hand, are released according to the
GNU GPL becuase either they use kernel code or they have been
developed independently. Their "restrictive" license should not be an
issue becuase those files are not meant to be samples that the user
may incorporate in his/her own work.

Even if nobody requires that, if kernel modules are released as Free
Software (possibly under the GPL) that's good for both the author and
the user, on our opinion.
