/*
 * Adding Asynchronous Entry Points to a Character Driver
 *
 *   (kernel driver)
 *
 * Take one of your earlier character drivers and add new entry points
 * for aio_read() and aio_write().
 *
 * To test this you'll need to write a user-space program that uses
 * the native Linux API.  Have it send out a number of write and read
 * requests and synchronize properly.
 *
 * We also present a solution using the Posix API for the user
 * application; note that this will never hit your driver unless you
 * comment out the normal read and write entry points in which case
 * the kernel will fall back on the asynchronous ones.
 *
 * Make sure you compile by linking with the right libraries; use
 * -laio for the Linux API and -lrt for the Posix API.  (You can use
 * both in either case as they don't conflict.)'
