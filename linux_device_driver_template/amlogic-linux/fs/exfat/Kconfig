	help
	  exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table), (also sometimes referred to
	  as FAT64) is a proprietary, patent-pending[2] file system suited 
	  especially for USB flash drives,[citation needed] introduced by Microsoft
	  for embedded devices in Windows Embedded CE 6.0, in their desktop operating
	  systems Windows Vista Service Pack 1[3] and Windows 7, and in their server 
	  operating system Windows Server 2008.[4]

	  exFAT can be used where the NTFS file system is not a feasible solution, 
	  due to data structure overhead, or where the file size or directory restrictions
	  of previous versions of the FAT file system are unacceptable

	bool "exFAT debug messages"

	help
	  Say Y here if you want the exFAT drivers to produce a bunch
	  of debug messages to the system log. Select this if you are having a
	  problem with exFAT and want to see more of what is going on.
