Memprof is a memory profiler and leak detector.

Requirements
============

 For the interface, memprof requires:

  - GTK+ 2.0
  - libglade 2.0

 These are all available from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/,
 but if binary packages are available from your distribution,
 it's much easier to install them that way.

Installation
============

./configure
make
make install

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org/, project memprof). You will need to create an
account for yourself.

Mailing list
============

You can find information about subscribing to the memprof mailing list
at: http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/memprof-list/.

FAQ
===

* What do the colors mean?

  Yellow = Allocated
  Blue = Allocated then freed (high-water-mark)
  Red = Leaked (after you press the "Leaks" toolbar button)

* What does the message:

   MemProf: Starter malloc exceeded available space

  mean?

  Currently, MemProf doesn't handle static constructors in
  C++ very well; all memory that they allocate comes out
  of a fixed size pool. If that size is exceeded, Memprof
  prints the above message and aborts the program. As a
  workaround, you may be able to increase the STARTER_SIZE
  #define in memintercept.c.
