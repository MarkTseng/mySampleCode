The goal of this project is to provide a simple portable memory allocation debugging
module (based on the standard C library calls) for C programmers. The module is written
in ANSI C. It features collecting overall memory statistic, a complete list of allocated
blocks with information by whom, where, and how much memory was allocated, a history of
freed blocks, address checking based on the stored info, a SIGSEGV catcher, verbose and
filtered dumping, and other things. Currently it is slightly above 400 lines of C code.

MemLeak is not a standalone program or library. You have to include this module into
your project makefiles. See memleak.c and memleak.h for instructions.
