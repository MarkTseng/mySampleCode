DESIGN
======
The shim uses a linked list to store references to allocated blocks.
It stores a reference to the block itself along with the size of the
block. New blocks are stored at the head of the list, and block
removals require a seek. Any unfreed blocks upon termination of the
program remain in the linked list and are printed.

The syscall tracer doesn't do anything fancy. It converts the given
program call argument to an array by using strtok before passing it to
execvp. It stores the system calls in a preallocated array. Only
syscalls that have been called at least once are printed.
