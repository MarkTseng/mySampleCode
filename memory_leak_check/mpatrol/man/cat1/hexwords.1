       The hheexxwwoorrddss command is a little tool that can be used  to
       generate  hexadecimal constants from a dictionary of known
       words.  Such numerical constants can  be  used  in  source
       files  for  a  variety of debugging problems, and problems
       with uninitialised variables are especially relevant since
       these special numbers will stand out if seen from within a
       debugger.  For example, here are  some  common  (and  some
       not-so-common)  32-bit  hexadecimal  constants that can be
       used as debugging aids:

           _w_o_r_d   _h_e_x _c_o_n_s_t_a_n_t
       addedbad   0xaddedbad
       allocate   0xa110ca7e
       badlabel   0xbad1abe1
       baseball   0xba5eba11
       codebabe   0xc0debabe
       codedbad   0xc0dedbad
       deadbeef   0xdeadbeef
       deadcode   0xdeadc0de
       failsafe   0xfa115afe
       feedface   0xfeedface
       freedata   0xf4eeda7a
       goodcode   0x600dc0de

       As can be seen above, many decimal digits can be  used  to
       represent  the  letters  that  they most closely resemble,
       along with the hexadecimal digits _A through _F.  This  pro-
       vides  a  much  larger  selection  of  words  that  can be
       matched, although the digits _3 and _8 cannot be used due to
       the  lack  of any similar-looking letters.  The digits and
       their corresponding letters are  given  in  the  following
       table.

       _d_i_g_i_t   _l_e_t_t_e_r
       0       O, o or Q
       1       I, i or l
       2       Z or z
       3       -
       4       q or R
       5       S or s
       6       G
       7       J or T
       8       -
       9       g
       A-F     A-F
       a-f     a-f

       The  _d_i_c_t_f_i_l_e argument must be a valid dictionary filename
       but  if  _d_i_c_t_f_i_l_e  is  omitted  then  hheexxwwoorrddss  will   use
       _/_u_s_r_/_d_i_c_t_/_w_o_r_d_s as the name of the dictionary file to use.
       If  that  cannot  be  found   then   hheexxwwoorrddss   will   try
       _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_/_d_i_c_t_/_w_o_r_d_s    and   _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_d_i_c_t_/_w_o_r_d_s.    The
       dictionary file must be a plain text  file  that  contains
       one  word  per  line,  otherwise  few  to no words will be
       matched.

       The hheexxwwoorrddss command currently makes use of  several  UNIX
       text processing commands in order to extract the words and
       their hexadecimal equivalents.  As a result, the  hheexxwwoorrddss
       command  is  only  likely  to work on UNIX platforms or on
       systems which have the necessary commands installed.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ----hheellpp [--hh]
              Displays a quick-reference option summary.

       ----mmaattcchh <_e_x_a_c_t|_l_o_w_e_r|_u_p_p_e_r|_a_n_y> [--mm]
              Sets the type of case-sensitivity to use.   A  set-
              ting  of _e_x_a_c_t performs a case-sensitive comparison
              of all of the words in the dictionary file and  the
              hexadecimal  digits,  whereas a setting of _a_n_y does
              not.  The _l_o_w_e_r  and  _u_p_p_e_r  settings  convert  the
              words  in  the  dictionary  file to lower and upper
              case respectively before performing  a  case-sensi-
              tive  comparison.   The default case-sensitivity is
              _e_x_a_c_t.

       ----mmaaxxiimmuumm <_c_o_u_n_t> [--uu]
              Sets the maximum number of letters to match.   None
              of  the hexadecimal numbers displayed will have any
              more digits than this.  The default is _8.

       ----mmiinniimmuumm <_c_o_u_n_t> [--ll]
              Sets the minimum number of letters to match.   None
              of  the hexadecimal numbers displayed will have any
              less digits than this.  The default is _4.

       ----vveerrssiioonn [--VV]
              Displays the version number of  the  hheexxwwoorrddss  com-
              mand.
