       The mmppeeddiitt command is used to invoke a text  editor  on  a
       given  source  file and optionally jump to a specific line
       number.  It is used as a support command  by  the  mpatrol
       library  when the EEDDIITT or LLIISSTT options are used but it can
       quite easily be used as a command  in  its  own  right  if
       properly  configured.  Because it is a shell script it can
       be easily configured to support other  editors,  but  this
       unfortunately limits it to UNIX platforms at the moment.

       The _s_o_u_r_c_e_f_i_l_e argument must be the filename of the source
       file to be edited or listed.  If the source file does  not
       exist then the contents of the MMPPAATTRROOLL__SSOOUURRCCEEPPAATTHH environ-
       ment variable will be used to help locate the source file,
       even  if  the  filename  contained an absolute or relative
       path component.  This environment variable should  consist
       of  a  colon-separated  list  of directory names which may
       contain absolute paths  or  be  relative  to  the  current
       directory;  the  first  directory  in  the  list  will  be
       searched first.   If  the  MMPPAATTRROOLL__SSOOUURRCCEEPPAATTHH  environment
       variable  is  not set then only the current directory will
       be searched.

       If the _l_i_n_e_n_u_m_b_e_r argument is omitted then it  is  assumed
       to  be  _1.   The  text  editor will attempt to jump to the
       specified line after opening the source  file.   The  text
       editor  that mmppeeddiitt uses is controlled by setting the EEDDII--
       TTOORR environment variable.  This can be  set  to  the  full
       pathname of the text editor to use or it can be set to the
       command that would normally be used  to  invoke  the  text
       editor, but it cannot also contain command line options.

       The currently supported editors are vvii, vviimm, eellvviiss, eemmaaccss,
       xxeemmaaccss, ppiiccoo and nnaannoo, and if the EEDDIITTOORR environment vari-
       able is not set then the default will be vvii.  Selecting an
       unsupported text editor will result in an error.  However,
       you  can  edit the mmppeeddiitt file to add support for your own
       favourite text editor as long as  it  supports  a  way  to
       immediately  jump  to  a  specific  line number when it is
       first started up.  Note that the  text  editor  must  also
       open  a new window to edit the source file so that it does
       not obscure any mpatrol diagnostic  messages,  and  if  it
       does  not  support this then a new terminal window must be
       opened for it to use.

       If the ----lliissttiinngg option is given on the command line  then
       the  mmppeeddiitt  command will display a context listing of the
       source file at the specified line number to  the  standard
       error  output  stream instead of invoking the text editor.
       The listing will be annotated with line numbers  and  will
       also  show the contents of the five lines before and after
       the specified line if possible.

       ----eeddiittoorr <_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e> [--ee]
              Specifies the text editor to use.   This  overrides
              the contents of the EEDDIITTOORR environment variable.

       ----hheellpp [--hh]
              Displays a quick-reference option summary.

       ----lliissttiinngg [--ll]
              Displays  a  context  listing  of  the  source line
              instead of invoking the text editor.

       ----ssoouurrccee--ddiirr <_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y> [--II]
              Adds a directory to the search path used to  locate
              the source file.  Multiple ----ssoouurrccee--ddiirr options may
              be given, and each will be prepended  to  the  MMPPAA--
              TTRROOLL__SSOOUURRCCEEPPAATTHH  environment  variable in the order
              given on the command line.

       ----vveerrssiioonn [--VV]
              Displays the version number of the mmppeeddiitt  command.
