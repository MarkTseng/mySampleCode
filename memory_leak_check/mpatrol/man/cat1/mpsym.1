       mpsym - locates missing symbolic information in an mpatrol

       The mmppssyymm command is used to parse a log file produced  by
       the  mpatrol  library and uses a debugger to append symbol
       names and source level information to  code  addresses  in
       stack  tracebacks.   This  should  be used if the UUSSEEDDEEBBUUGG
       option is not supported on a particular platform  or  does
       not  work  properly  with  a  specific  program.   It will
       replace all existing symbols and source level  information
       associated  with  the  stack tracebacks in the mpatrol log
       file and will display the resulting log file on the  stan-
       dard output file stream.

       The  _p_r_o_g_f_i_l_e  argument  must  be the filename of the exe-
       cutable file that produced the mpatrol  log  file  but  if
       _p_r_o_g_f_i_l_e  is omitted then mmppssyymm will use _a_._o_u_t as the name
       of the executable file to use.   The  mmppssyymm  command  will
       read  the  symbol  table  and debugging sections from this
       file in order to map the code addresses that appear in the
       mpatrol log file into symbol names and source level infor-
       mation.  If the executable file does not contain a  symbol
       table  then  no  symbol  names will be available and if it
       does not contain the appropriate debugging  sections  then
       no  source  level  information  will  be available either.
       Obviously, if the executable file is not the same  as  the
       one  that created the mpatrol log file then the final out-
       put will be wrong.

       The _l_o_g_f_i_l_e argument must be a valid mpatrol log  filename
       but  if _l_o_g_f_i_l_e is omitted then mmppssyymm will use _m_p_a_t_r_o_l_._l_o_g
       as the name of the log file to use, or _p_r_o_g_f_i_l_e_._l_o_g if  it
       can't  find that.  The mmppssyymm command makes two passes over
       the log file so the file must be randomly-accessable.

       The mmppssyymm command currently uses ggddbb as the debugger  with
       which  to obtain the additional information about the code
       addresses in the mpatrol log file.  It also makes  use  of
       several  UNIX  text processing commands, including ppeerrll if
       it is installed, in order to extract information from  the
       debugger's output and from the log file.  As a result, the
       mmppssyymm command is only likely to work on UNIX platforms  or
       on systems which have the necessary commands installed.
