README FOR THE MPATROL LIBRARY MANUAL PAGES


This directory may contain preformatted manual pages for the mpatrol library.
The manual pages will have been generated from the troff source using a variety
of tools and are provided partly for convenience and partly for people who do
not have suitable formatting tools installed on their system.  In all cases
these manual pages can be regenerated from the source, although there may be
slight changes in some files due to differences in the systems that they were
generated on.


The following files contain all of the information necessary to generate each of
the preformatted files.

  * man1/*.1 & man3/*.3
        Format:    TROFF
                   http://www.kohala.com/start/troff/troff.html
        Notes:     The unprocessed source of the mpatrol manual pages.


The following files are all formatted for on-line documentation.  They generally
contain little or no formatting codes, leaving the final formatting up to the
viewer program.
