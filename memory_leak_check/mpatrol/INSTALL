INSTALL FOR THE MPATROL LIBRARY


For instructions on how to build and install the mpatrol library and its tools
please see the mpatrol manual located in the doc directory.

If you wish to use GNU autoconf, automake and libtool to build and install
mpatrol you may do so by entering the pkg/auto directory and typing `./setup'.
This will construct the directory structure that is required by these tools and
will also create a configure script.  Please see the INSTALL file in that
directory for information on how to proceed.  Note that you can clean up the
pkg/auto directory by typing `make distclean' (if the configure script has
already been run) followed by `./cleanup'.
