Description: A powerful library for debugging memory allocations
 The mpatrol library is a powerful debugging tool that attempts to
 diagnose run-time errors that are caused by the wrong use of
 dynamically allocated memory.
 .
 Along with providing a comprehensive and configurable log of all
 dynamic memory operations that occurred during the lifetime of a
 program, the mpatrol library performs extensive checking to detect
 any misuse of dynamically allocated memory.
 .
 All of this functionality can be integrated into existing code
 through the inclusion of a single header file at compile-time.
 .
 All logging and tracing output from the mpatrol library is sent
 to a separate log file in order to keep its diagnostics separate
 from any that the program being tested might generate.
 .
 A wide variety of library settings can also be changed at
 run-time via an environment variable, thus removing the need to
 recompile or relink in order to change the library's behaviour.
