README FOR THE MPATROL LIBRARY TOOLS


This directory contains the source code for tools that are built on top of the
mpatrol library.  The functions that are defined in these files are intended to
be useful for specific applications as well as providing real-world examples of
how to extend mpatrol.  If you wish to use one of the source files in this
directory then you should first compile it and then link it into your program
along with the mpatrol library.

Alternatively, if you've already installed mpatrol on your system then there
should be an mpatrol subdirectory within the include directory where mpatrol.h
is installed that contains all of the header files in this directory.  There
should also be a libmptools library within the library directory where
libmpatrol is installed that contains an object file for each of the source
files in this directory.  You can then make use of a particular tool by
including its header file from the mpatrol include subdirectory and then linking
with the libmptools library.

If you've written a useful extension to mpatrol then you might wish to submit
it for inclusion in the next release of mpatrol.  Even if it's just for a
specific application, there might be other users out there that may benefit
from it.  You'll even get a credit in the manual!  Note that any documentation
should be written in the associated header file.
