	* README: Documented the USEMMAP option.

1999-10-14  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* src/option.c:
	Added the USEMMAP option for UNIX platforms that support mmap().

	* src/memory.c:
	Added support for allocating memory using mmap() on UNIX platforms that
	support it.

	* src/memory.h:
	Changed the name of the watch point control file handle field and added
	a memory mapped file handle field.

	* src/config.h: Added MP_MMAP_SUPPORT and MP_MMAP_FILENAME.

	* EXAMPLES: New file for illustrating how to use the library.

1999-10-12  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* src/alloc.c:
	Fixed the problem in splitnode() whereby the free node would be lost if
	there was no more system memory to allocate the leftmost or rightmost
	nodes.

	* src/symbol.c:
	Don't attempt to read from _DYNAMIC if its address is NULL, since that
	will be the case if the program is statically linked.

	* bin/mupdate:
	Only update ChangeLog if it has changed since the last release.

1999-10-05  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* src/info.c:
	Fixed a bug in __mp_checkinfo() when all allocations are pages and no
	freed allocations are being reused, since we don't need to check
	overflow buffers if the allocation has been freed.

	* src/stack.c:
	Fixed a bug in __mp_newframe() if using MP_BUILTINSTACK_SUPPORT when the
	loop went round one too many times, causing an infinite loop.

1999-10-03  Graeme Roy  <graeme@epc.co.uk>

	* src/inter.c:
	Fixed problem in __mp_info() where the check for a known memory block
	was doing an || instead of an && in the test.
