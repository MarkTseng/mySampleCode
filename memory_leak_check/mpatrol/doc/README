README FOR THE MPATROL LIBRARY DOCUMENTATION


This directory may contain preformatted documentation for the mpatrol library.
The documents will have been generated from the TeXinfo source (or from the
LaTeX source of the reference card) using a variety of tools and are provided
partly for convenience and partly for people who do not have suitable formatting
tools installed on their system.  In all cases these documents can be
regenerated from the source, although there may be slight changes in some files
due to differences in the systems that they were generated on.  Note that the
UNIX manual pages are not considered part of this documentation (although they
are kept up to date) and are located in a separate directory.


The following files contain all of the information necessary to generate each of
the preformatted files.
