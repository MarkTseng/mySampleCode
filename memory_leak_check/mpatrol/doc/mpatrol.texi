@unnumbered Foreword
@cindex foreword

I first started writing this library a few years ago when the company I work for
sent me out to a customer who had reported a memory leak, which he expected was
coming from the code generated by our C++ compiler.  A few years on and the
library has changed dramatically from its first beginnings, but I thought I'd
release it publicly in case anyone else found it useful.

When writing the library, I placed more emphasis on the quantity and quality of
information about allocated memory rather than the speed and efficiency of
allocating the actual memory.  This means that the library will use dramatically
more memory than normal dynamic memory allocation libraries and can slow down to
a crawl depending on which options you use.  However, the end results are likely
to be accurate and reliable, and in most cases the library will run quite
happily at a sane speed.

@cindex warranty
The mpatrol library is by no means the only library of its kind.  Solaris has
no less that 6 different malloc libraries, and there are plenty available as
freeware or as commercial products.  Try to keep in mind that mpatrol comes with
absolutely no warranty and so if it doesn't work for you and you need a fast
solution, try some of the other libraries or products available.  I have listed
some of the most popular at the end of this manual (@pxref{Related software}).

@cindex manual layout
This manual is arranged so that complete reference material on the mpatrol
library can be found in the appendices, while introductory and background
material can be found in the preceding chapters and sections.  For readers who
wish to delve right in and use the library, the Installation
(@pxref{Installation}) and Examples (@pxref{Examples}) chapters should be enough
to get started in combination with the quick reference card.  Otherwise, this
manual should be read from beginning to end in order to get the most out of the
software it describes.  Note that all of the output shown from the examples was
produced on 32-bit environments, although mpatrol can be built to support 64-bit
environments as well.

@cindex bug reports
@cindex reporting bugs
Due to their very nature, problems with dynamic memory allocations are
notoriously difficult to reproduce and debug, and this is likely to be the case
if you find a bug in the mpatrol library as it might be extremely hard to
reproduce on another system.  Details on how to report bugs are given elsewhere
in this document (@pxref{Notes}), but it would be very useful if you could try
to provide as much information as possible when reporting a problem, and that
includes having a look in the library source code to see if it's obvious what is
wrong.  However, please try to read the frequently asked questions
(@pxref{Frequently asked questions}) first in case your question or problem is
covered there since they are usually updated every time I receive a question
about mpatrol.

@cindex contacting the author
@cindex author, contacting
@cindex getting updates
@cindex updates
@cindex FreshMeat
@cindex SourceForge
The latest version of the mpatrol library and this manual can always be found at
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpatrol/}, and any correspondence relating
to mpatrol (bug reports, enhancement requests, compliments, etc.@:) should be
sent to @email{graemeroy@@users.sourceforge.net}.  I'd be very interested in
hearing any success stories with using mpatrol to debug programs, since I get
very little feedback apart from the occasional bug report.  The mpatrol library
is also registered at FreshMeat (@uref{http://freshmeat.net/projects/mpatrol/})
and SourceForge (@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpatrol/}) and several
other software sites so you can receive notification of updates there as well.
I normally only check my e-mail about once or twice a week, so don't expect an
immediate response.  There is also a discussion group at
@uref{http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mpatrol/} where you can post mpatrol-related
questions but you must first subscribe to the group before you can send mail to
it.

@cindex acknowledgements
@cindex contributors
Finally, I'd like to thank Stephan Springl for his help on reading debugging
information from object files via the GNU BFD library, and Adam Zell for
helping with patching the dynamic linker support functions for loading shared
libraries.  Both Alexander Barton and Dave Gibson helped to make mpatrol
thread-safe.  Roger Keane provided the perl code in the @command{mpsym} command
and also the idea for the @code{MP_USE_ATEXIT} feature macro.  Steve McIntyre
helped by diagnosing the @code{fork()} problem and provided example code on how
to fix it.  Peter Zijlstra contributed code to enhance stack traces for errors.

Boris Makushkin requested, helped with, and provided initial testing for the
FreeBSD port, and Ivan Finch, Gerrit Bruchhaeuser and Andreas Schallenberg did
the same for the Tru64 and SuSE ports.  Both Aleksandar Donev and Van Snyder
provided suggestions and code for using mpatrol with FORTRAN.  Michael Anthony
wrote the profdiff tool and Jerome Marant did the Debian GNU/Linux port.  Robert
Schmitt wrote a tutorial on how to use mpatrol on Windows platforms, located at
@uref{http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/w-p/win32/tutorials/print.php/c12231}.

If your native language is a language other than English, you can make use of
the many web-based translation tools that are now available for free on the
internet.  These can be used to translate pages of the on-line mpatrol manual
from English to your chosen language, and although they may not be perfect, they
should be able to translate most of the important text and convey the general
ideas across.  Note that Gerrit Bruchhaeuser has written a tutorial on mpatrol
in German which is available from @uref{http://www.c-handbuch.org/mpatrol.html}.

In addition, after spending well over 2000 hours designing and programming
mpatrol, my sanity would not have been preserved in the state it is in today
were it not for the music of The Chemical Brothers, The Manic Street Preachers,
Orbital and The Prodigy.  You can now argue how sane I am depending on your
musical tastes!

@cindex release builds
Oh, and always remember to do final release builds without the mpatrol library
as the library is much slower than normal malloc implementations and uses much
more memory.

Happy debugging!

@chapter Overview
@cindex overview

@cindex mpatrol
@cindex mpatrol library
@cindex library, mpatrol
@cindex run-time errors
@cindex errors, run-time
The mpatrol library is yet another link library that attempts to diagnose
run-time errors that are caused by the wrong use of dynamically allocated
memory.  If you don't know what the @code{malloc()} function or @code{operator
new[]} do then this library is probably not for you.  You have to have a certain
amount of programming expertise and a knowledge of how to run a command line
compiler and linker before you should attempt to use this.

Along with providing a comprehensive and configurable log of all dynamic memory
operations that occurred during the lifetime of a program, the mpatrol library
performs extensive checking to detect any misuse of dynamically allocated
memory.  All of this functionality can be integrated into existing code through
the inclusion of a single header file at compile-time.  On UNIX and Windows
platforms (and AmigaOS when using @command{gcc}) this may not even be necessary
as the mpatrol library can be linked with existing object files at link-time or,
on some platforms, even dynamically linked with existing programs at run-time.

All logging and tracing output from the mpatrol library is sent to a separate
log file in order to keep its diagnostics separate from any that the program
being tested might generate.  A wide variety of library settings can also be
changed at run-time via an environment variable, thus removing the need to
recompile or relink in order to change the library's behaviour.

A file containing a summary of the memory allocation profiling statistics for a
particular program can be produced by the mpatrol library.  This file can then
be read by a profiling tool which will display a set of tables based upon the
accumulated data.  The profiling information includes summaries of all of the
memory allocations listed by size and the function that allocated them and a
list of memory leaks with the call stack of the allocating function.  It also
includes a graph of all memory allocations listed in tabular form, and an
optional graph specification file for later processing by the @command{dot}
graph visualisation package.

A file containing a concise encoded trace of all memory allocations,
reallocations and deallocations made by a program can also be produced by the
mpatrol library.  This file can then be read by a tracing tool which will decode
the trace and display the events in tabular or graphical form, and also display
any relevant statistics that could be calculated.

The mpatrol library has been designed with the intention of replacing calls to
existing C and C++ memory allocation functions as seamlessly as possible, but
in many cases that may not be possible and slight code modifications may be
required.  However, a preprocessor macro containing the version of the mpatrol
library is provided for the purposes of conditional compilation so that release
builds and debug builds can be easily automated.

@chapter Features
@cindex mpatrol features
@cindex features

An overall list of features contained in the mpatrol library is given below.
This is not intended to be exhaustive since the best way to see what the library
does is to read the documentation and try it out.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Written for 32-bit and 64-bit UNIX, AmigaOS, Windows and Netware platforms.
Contains direct support for (and takes advantage of most of the features of)
AIX, DG/UX, DRS/NX, DYNIX/ptx, FreeBSD, HP/UX, Interix, IRIX, Linux, LynxOS,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, SINIX, Solaris, SunOS, Tru64 and UnixWare.  Also contains
target-specific code to take advantage of Alpha, Intel 80x86, Motorola 680x0
and 88xx0, MIPS, HP PA/RISC, IBM RS/6000, PowerPC and SPARC processors.

@item
Has the ability to read symbols from executable files and shared libraries in
the @file{a.out}, COFF, XCOFF, ELF32, ELF64 and Windows Portable Executable file
formats, and if the GNU BFD library is available then the mpatrol library can
read symbols from all of the file formats that it has support for as well.  Can
also liase with AIX, BSD-based, HP/UX, Interix, IRIX, OSF, SVR4-based and
Windows dynamic linkers in order to find out information about shared libraries.

@item
Can be built to allocate memory from a fixed-sized static array rather than
using heap memory from the system.

@cindex archive library
@cindex library, archive
@cindex shared library
@cindex library, shared
@cindex thread-safe library
@cindex library, thread-safe
@item
Can be built as archive, shared and/or thread-safe libraries on systems that
support them, or even as one large object file.  A lint library can also be
built from the mpatrol library on UNIX platforms.

@item
A release version of the mpatrol library is provided, which has the same
functional interface, but does not contain any of mpatrol's debugging, tracing
or profiling features.  It is intended to be used to quickly remove the mpatrol
library.

@item
Details of memory allocations and free memory are stored internally as a tree
structure for speed and also to allow the best fit allocation algorithm to be
used.  This also enables the library to perform intelligent resizing of memory
allocations and can be used to quickly determine if an address has been
allocated on the heap.

@item
Contains 19 replacement C dynamic memory allocation functions:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .1 .7
@item @code{malloc()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Allocates memory.
@item @code{calloc()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Allocates zero-filled memory.
@item @code{memalign()}

@tab Duplicates a string with a maximum length.
@item @code{realloc()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Resizes memory.
@item @code{reallocf()}
@tab BSD
@tab Resizes memory and frees on failure.
@item @code{recalloc()}
@tab old
@tab Resizes memory allocated by @code{calloc()}.
@item @code{expand()}
@tab old
@tab Resizes memory but does not relocate it.
@item @code{free()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Frees memory.
@item @code{cfree()}
@tab old
@tab Frees memory allocated by @code{calloc()}.
@item @code{dealloca()}
@tab new
@tab Explicitly frees temporary memory.
@end multitable

@item
Contains 5 replacement C dynamic memory extension functions:

@multitable @columnfractions .3 .7
@item @code{xmalloc()}
@tab Allocates memory without failure.
@item @code{xcalloc()}
@tab Allocates zero-filled memory without failure.
@item @code{xstrdup()}
@tab Duplicates a string without failure.
@item @code{xrealloc()}

Contains 6 replacement C dynamic memory alternative functions:

@multitable @columnfractions .3 .7
@item @code{MP_MALLOC()}
@tab Allocates memory without failure.
@item @code{MP_CALLOC()}
@tab Allocates zero-filled memory without failure.
@item @code{MP_STRDUP()}

@item @code{MP_REALLOC()}
@tab Resizes memory without failure.
@item @code{MP_FREE()}
@tab Frees memory.
@item @code{MP_FAILURE()}
@tab Sets the allocation failure handler.
@end multitable

@item
Contains 4 replacement C++ dynamic memory allocation operators (in both
@emph{throw} and @emph{nothrow} forms):

@multitable @columnfractions .3 .7
@item @code{operator new}
@tab Allocates memory.
@item @code{operator new[]}
@tab Allocates memory for an array.
@item @code{operator delete}
@tab Frees memory.
@item @code{operator delete[]}
@tab Frees memory allocated by @code{operator new[]}.
@end multitable

@item
Contains 10 replacement C memory operation functions:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .1 .7
@item @code{memset()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Fills memory with a specific byte.
@item @code{bzero()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Fills memory with the zero byte.
@item @code{memccpy()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Copies memory up to a specific byte.
@item @code{memcpy()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Copies non-overlapping memory.
@item @code{memmove()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Copies possibly-overlapping memory.
@item @code{bcopy()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Copies possibly-overlapping memory.
@item @code{memcmp()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Compares two blocks of memory.
@item @code{bcmp()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Compares two blocks of memory.
@item @code{memchr()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Searches memory for a specific byte.
@item @code{memmem()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Searches memory for specific bytes.
@end multitable

@item
All of the above functions can also be defined with an additional underscore
prepended to their external name in order to catch all uses of these functions
in the system and third-party libraries.

@item
Contains support for a user-defined low-memory handler function, including a
replacement for the C++ function, @code{set_new_handler()}.

@item
The C++ dynamic memory allocation operators make use of the preprocessor in
order to obtain source-level information.  If this causes problems then
replacement operator names may be used so that the existing operators will still
work.

@item
Contains support for automatically registering any functions whose names begin
with @samp{__mp_init_} and @samp{__mp_fini_} to be called when the mpatrol
library is initialised and terminated respectively.  A function is also provided
to register additional functions to be called when the mpatrol library
terminates.

@item
Contains support for user-defined prologue and epilogue callback functions,
which get called before and after every memory allocation, reallocation or
deallocation.

@item
A function is provided to return as much information as possible about a given
memory allocation or free block, and can be called at any time during program
execution.  A similar function is also provided for calling from within a
debugger and an example command file is provided for use with @command{gdb}.

@item
A function is provided to display library settings and heap usage statistics,
including peak memory usage.  This information is also displayed at program
termination, and can also be placed into a data structure at run-time via
another function.

@item
The library reads any user-controllable options at run-time from an environment
variable, but this does not have to be set as defaults will then be used.  This
prevents having to recompile anything in order to change any library settings.
An option exists to display a quick-reference summary of all of the recognised
options to the standard error file stream.  Library settings can also be set and
read from within user code after the library has been initialised by calling two
internal functions.

@item
All diagnostics and logging are sent to a file in the current directory, but
this can be overridden, including forcing the log file to be the standard output
or standard error file streams.  An environment variable specifying a default
directory in which to place log files can also be set.

@item
Options exist to log details of every memory allocation, reallocation or
deallocation when they occur.  A function exists to log the details of any
memory allocation to the mpatrol log file.

@item
Options exist to halt the program at a specific memory allocation, reallocation
or deallocation when running the program within a debugger.  These options have
no effect when running the program without a debugger.

@item
An option exists to enable memory allocation profiling, which forces a summary
of all memory allocation statistics to be written to a specified file for later
use by a profiling command.  The profiling file can also be written at a
specified frequency.  An environment variable specifying a default directory in
which to place profiling output files can also be set.

@item
A profiling command is provided which reads a profiling output file produced by
the mpatrol library and displays a set of tables based on the accumulated data.
The profiling information includes summaries of all of the memory allocations
listed by size and the function that allocated them and a list of memory leaks
with the call stack of the allocating function.  It also includes a graph of all
memory allocations listed in tabular form, and an optional graph specification
file for later processing by the @command{dot} graph visualisation package.

@item
An option exists to enable memory allocation tracing, which forces certain
details for every memory allocation event to be written to a specified file for
later use by a tracing command.  The tracing file is written in a concise
encoded form so as to keep the size of the file down.  An environment variable
specifying a default directory in which to place tracing output files can also
be set.

@cindex trace-driven simulation
@cindex simulation, trace-driven
@item
A tracing command is provided which reads a tracing output file produced by the
mpatrol library and displays the memory allocation events in tabular or
graphical form.  It also displays any relevant statistics that could be
calculated, and has options to write out the trace in HATF format or write out
a trace-driven memory allocation simulation program as C source code.

@item
On UNIX platforms, the @code{mmap()} function can optionally be used to allocate
user memory instead of the @code{sbrk()} function, but only if the system
supports it.  If @code{mmap()} is supported then internal mpatrol library memory
is normally allocated with this function in order to segregate it from user
memory but this behaviour can be swapped around.

@item
On non-UNIX platforms where the mpatrol library overrides @code{malloc()}
without requiring the inclusion of @file{mpatrol.h}, versions of the UNIX
functions @code{brk()} and @code{sbrk()} are provided for compatibility with
certain libraries.  These should @emph{not} be called by user code as they have
only limited functionality.

@item
All newly-allocated memory that is not allocated by the @code{calloc()} or
@code{recalloc()} functions will be pre-filled with a non-zero value in order to
catch out programs that wrongly assume that all newly-allocated memory is
zeroed.  This value can be modified at run-time.

@item
Can automatically check to see if there have been any illegal writes to bytes
located just before and after every memory allocation through the use of
overflow buffers.  The size of such overflow buffers and the value to pre-fill
them with can be modified at run-time.  The checks will be performed before
every memory allocation call to ensure that nothing has overwritten the
overflow buffers, but a function is also provided to perform additional checks
under the programmer's control and an option exists to specify a range and
frequency in which checks will be performed.

@item
On systems that support them, watch point areas can be used instead of overflow
buffers so that every read and write to memory is checked to ensure that it is
not within an overflow buffer.

@item
Supports the @option{-fcheck-memory-usage} option of @command{gcc} to check all
heap memory accesses in programs that were compiled with that option.  Currently
this only supports checking that memory accesses do not overflow heap
allocations or access free memory, rather than keeping records of individual
memory accesses that GNU Checker does.

@item
Can automatically check to see if there have been any illegal writes to free
memory blocks.  The value to pre-fill free memory blocks with can be modified
at run-time.  The check will be performed before every memory allocation call
to ensure that nothing has overwritten the free memory block, but a function is
also provided to perform additional checks under the programmer's control and
an option exists to specify a range in which checks will be performed.

@item
On systems that support memory protection, every memory allocation can
optionally be allocated at least one page of memory.  That way, any free memory
blocks can be made read and write protected so that nothing can access free
memory on the heap.  An option is provided to specify whether all memory
allocations should be allocated at the start or at the end of such pages, and
the bytes left over within the pages become overflow buffers.

@item
All freed memory allocations can optionally be prevented from being returned to
the free memory pool.  This is useful for detecting if use is being made of
freed memory just after a memory allocation has been freed.  The contents of
the memory allocation can either be preserved or can be pre-filled with a value
in order to detect illegal writes to the freed memory allocation.  In addition,
only a specified number of recently-freed memory allocations can be prevented
from being returned to the free memory pool.  Any older freed memory allocations
will then eventually be reused.

@item
The @code{alloca()}, @code{strdupa()} and @code{strndupa()} functions are
implemented so that the temporary stack-based allocations that they would
normally make are now temporary heap-based allocations that can be traced by
mpatrol.  Such allocations will be implicitly freed when the function that
allocated them returns, but a function also exists to explicitly free them as
well.

@item
Calls to memory operation functions (such as @code{memset()} or @code{memcpy()})
have their arguments checked to ensure that they do not pass null pointers or
attempt to read or write memory straddling the boundary of a previously
allocated memory block, although an option exists to turn such an error into a
warning so that the operation can still be performed.  Tracing from all such
functions can also optionally be written to the log file.

@item
The internal data structures used by the library are kept separate from the
rest of the memory allocations.  On systems that support memory protection, all
of these internal data structures will be write-protected in order to prevent
corruption by the calling program.  This feature can be overridden at run-time
as it can slow the program down.

@cindex signals
@item
Certain signals can be saved and restored on entry to each library function and
@code{errno} is set to @code{ENOMEM} if memory cannot be allocated, except for
the ANSI C++ operators which throw the @code{std::bad_alloc} exception instead.

@item
On systems that support memory protection, the library attempts to detect any
illegal memory accesses and display as much information as it can obtain about
the address in question and where the illegal memory access occurred.

@item
A call stack traceback from any function performing a memory allocation is
stored if the library supports this feature on the system it is being run on.
This information can then be displayed when information about a specific memory
allocation is required.  Many different call stack traceback implementations are
provided for different platforms.  A function is also provided to write the
current call stack to the mpatrol log file.

@item
Symbol table details from executable files and shared libraries are
automatically read on systems that support this feature in order to make the
call stack tracebacks more meaningful.  An option also exists to display a
complete list of the symbols that were read by the library at program
termination.  A function is also provided to return symbolic information about
any code address.

@item
Compiler-generated line number tables from any debugging sections that exist
in executable files and shared libraries can also be used by the mpatrol library
in order to provide more meaningful information in call stack tracebacks.  An
external command is also provided to make use of a debugger to get such
information if one is available.

@item
If the library is unable to automatically determine a program's executable
filename to read symbols from then an option exists to specify the full path to
the program's executable file.

@item
Options are provided to edit and list a source file at a specific line number
when a warning or error occurs due to that source line.  An external command
which provides this functionality outwith the mpatrol library is included, and
functions are provided to do this from within user code.

@item
An option exists to change the default alignment used for general-purpose memory
allocations.

@item
Contains support for a user-defined limit to available memory which can be
useful for stress-testing a program in simulated low memory conditions.

@item
Contains a feature to randomly fail a specific frequency of memory allocations
which can be useful for stress-testing error recovery code in a program.

@item
An option exists to display a complete memory map of the heap at program
termination.  A function to do this is also available to call at any point
during program execution.

@item
A function is provided to take a snapshot of the heap at the current point in
execution.  The value returned by this function can then be used to pinpoint
the differences in heap allocation details between that point and a later point
in the program.

@item
Functions are provided to iterate across all of the current heap allocations
and call a user-defined callback function for each one they find.

@item
A leak table is provided, which records a flat profile of memory allocation
behaviour between two points in a program and is keyed by source file location.
Memory allocation events can either be recorded in the leak table automatically
via a run-time option or the leak table can be manipulated through several
functions.

@item
Functions are provided to write user-defined information directly to the mpatrol
log file, as well as hexadecimal memory dumps of any memory location.

@item
Options exist to display all freed and unfreed memory allocations at program
termination in order to detect memory leaks, as well as all free memory blocks.
A separate program is also provided for locating memory leaks in unfinished log
files.

@item
An option exists to abort the program with a failure condition if there are more
than a specified number of unfreed memory allocations at program termination.
This could be useful for batch testing in order to check that all tests free up
most of their allocated memory.

@item
Memory allocations can be @emph{marked} to indicate to the mpatrol library that
they should remain allocated for the lifetime of the program and should not be
freed or be listed as a memory leak.

@item
Functions always report if their arguments are illegal in order to pinpoint any
errors, and options exist to perform rigorous checking of arguments when
allocating, reallocating and freeing memory.  In addition, checking is performed
to ensure that memory allocated by @code{operator new[]} is not freed with
@code{free()} for example.

@item
The type of function performing a memory allocation is always stored along with
the allocation, as well as the file and line number it was called from.  If
compiled with @command{gcc}, the function name will also be stored and the
thread identifier will be stored if using the thread-safe library.

@item
The library uses a header file to redefine the memory allocation functions as
macros in order to obtain more information about where they were called from.
This is not strictly required on UNIX and Windows platforms (and AmigaOS when
using @command{gcc}), since the library automatically redefines the default
system memory allocation functions.  All redefinitions in the header can also
be disabled by defining the @code{NDEBUG} preprocessor macro, which also
disables the effect of calling any mpatrol library function.

@item
A command is supplied to run a program that was linked with the mpatrol library
with any specified options on the command line.  On some UNIX platforms, an
option also exists to override the default memory allocation routines for any
dynamically-linked program that was not previously linked with the mpatrol
library.

@item
The mpatrol library can be built to liaise with Parasoft Inuse, a commercial
graphical memory usage tool that can display the current memory map of a running
process.  Inuse is supplied with Parasoft Insure++.

@item
Comes with a library of tools that are built on top of the mpatrol library and
can be used to extend it for specific applications.

@item
An automake macro is provided to ease the integration of mpatrol into a new or
existing project.

@item
A small tool is provided to read a dictionary file and display all of the words
that can be represented in hexadecimal form.  Such hexadecimal constants can be
used to initialise variables in user programs in order to aid debugging.

@item
The library and tools can be built using the GNU autoconf, automake and libtool
utilities.  Build scripts are also supplied to build both installation packages
and binary distributions.  A Linux Software Map file is also provided.

@cindex test suite
@item
A small test suite is provided in order to test basic features.

@item
User documentation is currently available in @TeX{}info format as well as UNIX
manual pages and a quick reference card.  The source code for the library and
tools can also be formatted for a printed manual.

@cindex building the library
@cindex library, building

@cindex Amiga 4000/040
The mpatrol library was initially developed on an Amiga 4000/040 running AmigaOS
3.1.  I then installed Red Hat Linux 5.1 on my Amiga and added support for
Linux/m68k.  Just after mpatrol was first released I purchased a Windows 98
laptop and put my Amiga in retirement, so development continued on Windows and
Linux on the Intel x68 platform.  I've tried my best to make it as easy as
possible to build and install mpatrol on any system, but it isn't likely to run
smoothly for everybody.  However, there shouldn't be any major problems if you
perform the following steps.

@cindex CHECKSUMS
@cindex md5sum
Note that if you want to check the integrity of the files that came with the
mpatrol distribution you can use the @file{CHECKSUMS} file in the @file{mpatrol}
base directory.  You must have the @command{md5sum} command installed on your
system in order to make use of this file.

@cindex autoconf
@cindex automake
@cindex libtool
@cindex configure
@cindex setup
@cindex cleanup
@cindex distclean (make target)
If you wish to use GNU autoconf, automake and libtool to build and install
mpatrol you may do so by entering the @file{pkg/auto} directory and typing
@samp{./setup}.  This will construct the directory structure that is required
by these tools and will also create a @file{configure} script.  Please see the
@file{INSTALL} file in that directory for information on how to proceed.  Note
that you can clean up the @file{pkg/auto} directory by typing @samp{make
distclean} (if the @file{configure} script has already been run) followed by
@samp{./cleanup}.

If you have problems building with the @file{configure} script then you may
need to regenerate the autoconf, automake and libtool configuration files to
suit your particular system.  To do this, edit the @file{setup} file and change
the setting of @samp{generate} from @samp{0} to @samp{1}.  Then re-execute
the @file{setup} script, making sure that you have deleted the old files
beforehand.

For a manual installation, perform the following steps.

@enumerate 1
@item
Go into the @file{build} directory and then into the appropriate subdirectory
for your system.

@cindex Makefile
@cindex CC
@cindex AR
@cindex LD
@cindex CFLAGS
@cindex OFLAGS
@cindex SFLAGS
@cindex TFLAGS
@cindex GUISUP
@cindex compiling
@cindex compiler
@cindex linking
@cindex linker
@cindex optimisation
@item
Edit the @file{Makefile} in that directory and check that it is using the
appropriate compiler and build tools.  The @code{CC} macro specifies the
compiler@footnote{On many systems this actually a C++ compiler by default, and
should be a C++ compiler if you wish to use the C++ operators.}, the @code{AR}
macro specifies the tool used to build the archive library and the @code{LD}
macro specifies the tool to build the shared library.  The @code{CFLAGS} macro
specifies compiler options that are always to be used, the @code{OFLAGS} macro
specifies optimisation options for the compiler, the @code{SFLAGS} macro
specifies options to be passed to the compiler when building a shared library
and the @code{TFLAGS} macro specifies options to be passed to the compiler when
building a thread-safe library.  You may also need to change the library names
and library build commands on different systems.

Note that the generic UNIX @file{Makefile} contains a macro called @code{GUISUP}
which is set to @code{false} by default.  If it is set to @code{true} then the
@command{mptrace} command will be built with GUI support enabled.  However,
your system must contain the correct header files and libraries in order to
support this.

@cindex make
@cindex all (make target)
@cindex lint (make target)
@cindex clean (make target)
@cindex clobber (make target)
@cindex lint
@item
Use the @command{make} command (or equivalent) to build the mpatrol library in
archive form.  The @samp{all} target builds all possible combinations of the
mpatrol library for your system.  The @samp{clean} target removes all relevant
object files from the current directory, while the @samp{clobber} target also
removes all libraries that have been built from the current directory.  On some
UNIX platforms, the @samp{lint} target will build a @command{lint} library for
the mpatrol library.

@cindex Inuse
@item
If the mpatrol library is to be built with support for Parasoft Inuse then the
@code{MP_INUSE_SUPPORT} preprocessor macro must be defined in the
@code{CFLAGS} portion of the @file{Makefile} before building.  This will ensure
that Inuse will be notified of every memory allocation, reallocation and
deallocation, but the Insure++ runtime library will also have to be linked in
with any program that uses mpatrol.

@cindex symbolic links
@cindex links, symbolic
@cindex ldconfig
@item
Copy all of the libraries that have been built into your local library
directory.  If there were symbolic links created in the @file{build} directory
then these should be recreated in the local library directory rather than simply
copying them.  You may need to run a command such as @command{ldconfig} in order
for the system to recognise the newly-installed libraries, and you may also need
to add the filename of the directory containing the newly-installed libraries to
an environment variable such as @env{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} if you installed the
libraries in a non-standard location.

@item
Copy the @command{mpatrol}, @command{mprof}, @command{mptrace} and
@command{mleak} programs that have been built into your local bin directory.
You may also wish to copy the @command{mpsym}, @command{mpedit} and
@command{hexwords} commands to your local bin directory as well if your system
supports Bourne shell scripts.

@item
Go up two directory levels into the @file{src} directory and copy the
@file{mpatrol.h}, @file{mpalloc.h} and @file{mpdebug.h} header files into your
local include directory.

@item
Go up one directory level into the @file{tools} directory and copy all of the
header files into the @file{mpatrol} subdirectory (which you'll need to create)
in your local include directory.

@cindex manual pages
@item
On UNIX platforms, go up one directory level into the @file{man} directory and
copy the @file{man1} and @file{man3} subdirectories to your local man directory.
Unfortunately, the location for manual pages varies from system to system so you
may or may not also be able to copy the @file{cat1} and @file{cat3}
subdirectories as well.  The @file{man*} subdirectories contain the unformatted
manual pages while the @file{cat*} subdirectories contain the formatted manual
pages.

@cindex @TeX{}info
@cindex La@TeX{}
@cindex documentation
@cindex reference card
@cindex quick reference card
@cindex printing
@item
Go up one directory level into the @file{doc} directory and examine the files
located there.  The @file{mpatrol.texi} file contains the @TeX{}info source for
this manual and can be translated into a wide variety of documentation formats.
The @file{refcard.tex} file contains the La@TeX{} source for the quick reference
card and can be translated into formats suitable for printing onto a few pages.
There should already be translated files in the @file{doc} directory, but if not
you will have to generate them yourself using the @file{Makefile} provided.  You
can then install or print these documents.

@cindex source code documentation
The mpatrol library source code can also be formatted for a printed manual for
later perusal.  The @samp{source} target in the @file{Makefile} within the
@file{doc} directory can be used to build the source code documentation in DVI,
postscript and PDF formats, but be prepared for a large number of pages!

If you are not installing on a system that supports UNIX manual pages then you
should also check in the @file{man} directory to ensure that there are
alternative formats for the mpatrol manual pages that you can install.  If not,
you will have to generate them yourself using the @file{Makefile} provided.
@end enumerate

@cindex PKG package
@cindex SD/UX package
@cindex RPM package
@cindex Debian package
@cindex TAR archive
@cindex LhA archive
@cindex ZIP archive
Alternatively, the @file{pkg} directory contains files that can be used to
automatically generate a @emph{package} in a specific format suitable for
installation on a system.  Four package formats (PKG, SD/UX, RPM and Debian) and
three archive formats are currently supported (generic tape archive, LhA and
ZIP).

The first package format is generally used on UNIX SVR4 systems, while the
second is used on HP/UX systems.  The RPM and Debian package formats were
introduced by Red Hat and Debian respectively for use in their Linux
distributions.

@cindex Aminet
@cindex WinSite
The generic tape archive can be used as a distribution for UNIX systems where no
package format is supported, but it does not contain information on how to
install the files on the system once they have been extracted from the
distribution.  The LhA and ZIP formats are also roughly the same, but the LhA
format is intended for Amiga systems and is used for Aminet distributions, while
the ZIP format is intended for Windows systems and is used for WinSite
distributions.

You should really know what you are doing before you attempt to build a package,
and you should also be aware that some of the package files may need to be
modified before you begin.

@cindex Linux Software Map
@cindex LSM
In addition, a Linux Software Map index file exists in the @file{pkg/lsm}
directory.

@cindex extra
Note that the @file{extra} directory that comes with the mpatrol distribution
contains several prototype configuration files for certain third-party programs.
These files should be examined so that you can decide whether to integrate their
contents into your existing configuration files.  The purpose of each file is
described in the relevant sections of this manual.

@chapter Integration
@cindex integration

This section describes how to go about adding or removing the mpatrol library
from your code.  There are several levels for each category so it is worth
reading about each before proceeding.

@menu
* Adding mpatrol::              Adding mpatrol to your program.
* Removing mpatrol::            Removing mpatrol from your program.
@end menu

@node Adding mpatrol, Removing mpatrol, , Integration
@section Adding mpatrol
@cindex adding mpatrol

@cindex recompilation
The following steps should allow you to easily integrate the mpatrol library
into an existing application, although some of them may not be available to do
on many platforms.  They are listed in the order of number of changes required
to modify existing code --- the last step will require a complete recompilation
of all your code.

@enumerate 1
@item
This step is currently only available on DYNIX/ptx, FreeBSD, Interix, IRIX,
Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and Tru64 platforms and on
DG/UX 4.20MU07@footnote{Also available on DG/UX 4.20MU05 with patch
dgux_R4.20MU05.p59 and DG/UX 4.20MU06 with patch dgux_R4.20MU06.p08.} or later
platforms with the @env{LD_PRELOAD} feature.

If your program or application has been dynamically linked with the system C
library (@file{libc.so}) or an alternative malloc shared library then you can
use the @option{--dynamic} option to the @file{mpatrol} command to override the
default definitions of @code{malloc()}, etc.@: at run-time without having to
relink your program.  If your program is multithreaded then you must also add
the @option{--threads} option to pick up the multithreaded shared libraries
instead.

For example, if your program's executable file is called @file{testprog} and it
accepts an option specifying an input file, you can force the system's dynamic
linker to use mpatrol's versions of @code{malloc()}, etc.@: instead of the
default versions by typing:

@smallexample
mpatrol --dynamic ./testprog -i file
@end smallexample

The resulting log file should be called @file{mpatrol.<procid>.log} by default
(where @var{procid} is the current process id), but if no such file exists after
running the @file{mpatrol} command then it will not be possible to force the
run-time linking of mpatrol functions to your program and you will have to
proceed to the next step.  Note that the @command{mpatrol} command overrides
any previous setting of the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable.

@item
This step is currently only available on UNIX and Windows platforms (and AmigaOS
when using @command{gcc}).

You should be able to link in the mpatrol library when linking your program
without having to recompile any of your object files or libraries, but this will
only be worthwhile on systems where stack tracebacks are supported, otherwise
you should proceed to the next step since there will not be enough information
for you to tell where the calls to dynamic memory allocation functions took
place.

Information on how to link the mpatrol library to an application is given at the
start of the examples (@pxref{Examples}), but you should note that if your
program does not directly call any of the functions in the mpatrol library then
it will not be linked in and you will not see a log file being generated when
you run it.  You can force the linking of the mpatrol library by causing
@code{malloc()} to be undefined on the link line, usually through the use of the
@option{-u} linker option.

If your program is multithreaded then you must use the thread-safe version of
the mpatrol library and possibly also link in the system threads library as
well.  Not doing this will usually result in your program failing somewhere in
the mpatrol library code.

@item
All of the following steps will require you to recompile some or all of your
code so that your code calls dynamic memory allocation functions from the
mpatrol library rather than the system C library.

This first step is only available when using @command{gcc}.

You can make use of the @command{gcc} option @option{-fcheck-memory-usage} which
instructs the compiler to place calls to error-checking functions before each
access to memory.  This can result in a dramatic slowdown of your code so you
may wish to limit the use of this option to a few source files, but it does
provide a very thorough method of ensuring that you do not access memory beyond
the bounds of a memory allocation or attempt to access free memory.  However,
be aware that the checks are only placed in the bodies of functions that have
been compiled with this option and are missing from all functions that have not.
You must link in the mpatrol library when using this option, otherwise you will
get linker errors.

The @option{-fcheck-memory-usage} option was added to @command{gcc} to support
GNU Checker, which can be considered to be the run-time system for this option.
GNU Checker also includes the ability to detect reads from uninitialised memory,
something that mpatrol does not currently support, and deals with stack objects
as well.  GNU Checker cannot be used in conjunction with mpatrol.

@item
For this step, if you have a rough idea of where the function calls lie that you
would like to trace or test, you need only recompile the relevant source files.
You should modify these source files to include the @file{mpatrol.h} header file
before any calls to dynamic memory allocation or memory operation functions.

However, you should take particular care to ensure that all calls to memory
allocation functions in the mpatrol library will be matched by calls to memory
reallocation or deallocation functions in the mpatrol library, since if they are
unmatched then the log file will either fill up with errors complaining about
trying to free unknown allocations, or warnings about unfreed memory allocations
at the end of execution.

@item
This step requires you to recompile all of your source files to include the
@file{mpatrol.h} header file.  Obviously, this will take the longest amount of
time to integrate, but need not require you to change any source files if the
compiler you are using has a command line option to include a specific header
file before any source files.

For example, @command{gcc} comes with a @option{-include} option which has this
feature, so if you had to recompile a source file called @file{test.c} then the
following command would allow you to include @file{mpatrol.h} without having
to modify the source file:

@smallexample
gcc -include /usr/local/include/mpatrol.h -c test.c
@end smallexample
@end enumerate

In all cases, it will be desirable to compile your source files with
compiler-generated debugging information since that may be able to be used by
the @option{USEDEBUG} option or the @command{mpsym} command.  In addition, more
symbolic information will be available if the executable files have not had
their symbol tables stripped from them, although mpatrol can also fall back to
using the dynamic symbol table from dynamically linked executable files.

@cindex JNI
The mpatrol library can also be used with JNI applications.  To do this, simply
link the archive form of the thread-safe mpatrol library with your JNI
application.  That way you won't end up profiling the entire JVM.

@cindex AM_WITH_MPATROL
Note that an automake macro is now provided to allow you to integrate mpatrol
into a new or existing project that uses the GNU autoconf and automake tools.
It is located in @file{extra/mpatrol.m4}, which should be copied to the
directory containing all of the local autoconf and automake macros on your
system, usually @file{/usr/local/share/aclocal}.  The automake macro it defines
is called @code{AM_WITH_MPATROL}, which should be added to the libraries section
in the @file{configure.in} file for your project.  It takes one optional
parameter specifying whether mpatrol should be included in the project
(@samp{yes}) or not (@samp{no}).  This can also be specified as @samp{threads}
if you wish to use the threadsafe version of the mpatrol library.  You can
override the value of the optional parameter with the @option{--with-mpatrol}
option to the resulting @file{configure} shell script.

@cindex HAVE_MPATROL
@cindex HAVE_MPALLOC
@cindex mpdebug.h
If you are using the @code{AM_WITH_MPATROL} automake macro then you may wish to
use the @file{mpdebug.h} header file instead of @file{mpatrol.h}.  This ensures
that the @code{MP_MALLOC()} family of functions are always defined, even if
libmpatrol or libmpalloc are unavailable.  It makes use of the
@code{HAVE_MPATROL} and @code{HAVE_MPALLOC} preprocessor macros that are
controlled by the automake macro, but in other respects behaves in exactly the
same way as @file{mpatrol.h}.

@node Removing mpatrol, , Adding mpatrol, Integration
@section Removing mpatrol
@cindex removing mpatrol

Once you have ironed out all of the problems in your code with the help of the
mpatrol library, there will come a time where you wish to build your program
without any of its debugging features, either to improve the speed that it runs
at, or perhaps even for a release.  Choose one of the following steps to help
you remove the mpatrol library from your program (you only need to perform them
if you linked your program with the mpatrol library).

@enumerate 1
@item
The quickest way to remove the mpatrol library from your application is to
link with libmpalloc instead of libmpatrol.  This contains replacements for all
of the mpatrol library functions, either implementing memory allocation or
memory operation functions with the system C library, or doing nothing in the
functions which perform debugging, profiling or tracing.  This method is a very
quick way to remove the mpatrol library but will not result in very efficient
code.

@item
The next option is to recompile all of the source files which include the
@file{mpatrol.h} header file, but this time define the @code{NDEBUG}
preprocessor macro.  This automatically disables the redefinition of
@code{malloc()}, etc.@: and prevents calls being made to any mpatrol library
functions.  Obviously, this option is the most time-consuming of the two, but
will result in the complete removal of all references to the mpatrol library.

@item
The final option is to guard all of the mpatrol-specific code in your program
with a preprocessor macro, possibly called @code{HAVE_MPATROL}, and then
recompiling all of your source code with this macro undefined.  This is the best
option but relies on you having originally made these changes when you first
started integrating the mpatrol library into your program.
@end enumerate

Note that if you used the @code{AM_WITH_MPATROL} automake macro as detailed in
the previous section to build your application then you should perform a clean
recompilation using the @option{--without-mpatrol} option to the
@file{configure} shell script in order to completely remove the mpatrol library.

Note also that if you used the @option{-fcheck-memory-usage} option of the GNU
compiler to check all memory accesses then you must recompile without that
option in order for your program to run at a reasonable speed.

@chapter Memory allocations
@cindex memory allocations

@cindex C
@cindex C++
@cindex Pascal
@cindex BASIC
@cindex FORTRAN
In the C and C++ programming languages there are generally three different types
of memory allocation that can be used to hold the contents of variables.  Other
programming languages such as Pascal, BASIC and FORTRAN also support some of
these types of allocation, although their implementations may be slightly
different.

@menu
* Static memory allocations::   Fixed location, fixed size.
* Stack memory allocations::    Variable location, fixed size.
* Dynamic memory allocations::  Variable location, variable size.

@cindex static memory allocations
@cindex memory allocations, static

@cindex file scope variables
@cindex variables, file scope
@cindex local static variables
@cindex variables, local static
The first type of memory allocation is known as a @emph{static memory
allocation}, which corresponds to file scope variables and local static
variables.  The addresses and sizes of these allocations are fixed at the time
of compilation@footnote{Or more accurately, at link time.} and so they can be
placed in a fixed-sized data area which then corresponds to a section within the
final linked executable file.  Such memory allocations are called static because
they do not vary in location or size during the lifetime of the program.

@cindex data sections
@cindex sections
@cindex BSS
There can be many types of data sections within an executable file; the three
most common are normal data, BSS data and read-only data.  BSS data contains
variables and arrays which are to be initialised to zero at run-time and so is
treated as a special case, since the actual contents of the section need not be
stored in the executable file.  Read-only data consists of constant variables
and arrays whose contents are guaranteed not to change when a program is being
run.  For example, on a typical SVR4 UNIX system the following variable
definitions would result in them being placed in the following sections:

@smallexample
int a;           /* BSS data */
int b = 1;       /* normal data */
const int c = 2; /* read-only data */
@end smallexample

In C the first example would be considered a @emph{tentative} declaration, and
if there was no subsequent definition of that variable in the current
translation unit then it would become a @emph{common} variable in the resulting
object file.  When the object file gets linked with other object files, any
common variables with the same name become one variable, or take their
definition from a non-tentative definition of that variable.  In the former
case, the variable is placed in the BSS section.  Note that C++ has no support
for tentative declarations.

As all static memory allocations have sizes and address offsets that are known
at compile-time and are explicitly initialised, there is very little that can go
wrong with them.  Data can be read or written past the end of such variables,
but that is a common problem with all memory allocations and is generally easy
to locate in that case.  On systems that separate read-only data from normal
data, writing to a read-only variable can be quickly diagnosed at run-time.

The second type of memory allocation is known as a @emph{stack memory
allocation}, which corresponds to non-static local variables and call-by-value
parameter variables.  The sizes of these allocations are fixed at the time of
compilation but their addresses will vary depending on when the function which
defines them is called.  Their contents are not immediately initialised, and
must be explicitly initialised by the programmer upon entry to the function or
when they become visible in scope.

@cindex stack
@cindex registers
Such memory allocations are placed in a system memory area called the
@emph{stack}, which is allocated per process@footnote{Or per thread on some
systems.} and generally grows down in memory.  When a function is called, the
state of the calling function must be preserved so that when the called function
returns, the calling function can resume execution.  That state is stored on the
stack, including all local variables and parameters.  The compiler generates
code to increase the size of the stack upon entry to a function, and decrease
the size of the stack upon exit from a function, as well as saving and restoring
the values of registers.

There are a few common problems using stack memory allocations, and most
generally involve uninitialised variables, which a good compiler can usually
diagnose at compile-time.  Some compilers also have options to initialise all
local variables with a bit pattern so that uninitialised stack variables will
cause program faults at run-time.  As with static memory allocations, there can
be problems with reading or writing past the end of stack variables, but as
their sizes are fixed these can usually easily be located.

@node Dynamic memory allocations, , Stack memory allocations, Memory allocations
@section Dynamic memory allocations
@cindex dynamic memory allocations
@cindex memory allocations, dynamic

The last type of memory allocation is known as a @emph{dynamic memory
allocation}, which corresponds to memory allocated via @code{malloc()} or
@code{operator new[]}.  The sizes, addresses and contents of such memory vary
at run-time and so can cause a lot of problems when trying to diagnose a fault
in a program.  These memory allocations are called dynamic memory allocations
because their location and size can vary throughout the lifetime of a program.

@cindex heap
@cindex garbage collector
@cindex ML
Such memory allocations are placed in a system memory area called the
@emph{heap}, which is allocated per process on some systems, but on others may
be allocated directly from the system in scattered blocks.  Unlike memory
allocated on the stack, memory allocated on the heap is not freed when a
function or scope is exited and so must be explicitly freed by the programmer.
The pattern of allocations and deallocations is not guaranteed to be (and is not
really expected to be) linear and so the functions that allocate memory from the
heap must be able to efficiently reuse freed memory and resize existing
allocated memory on request.  In some programming languages there is support for
a @emph{garbage collector}, which attempts to automatically free memory that has
had all references to it removed, but this has traditionally not been very
popular for programming languages such as C and C++, and has been more widely
used in functional languages like ML@footnote{There is currently at least one
garbage collection package available for C and C++ (@pxref{Related software}).}.

Because dynamic memory allocations are performed at run-time rather than
compile-time, they are outwith the domain of the compiler and must be
implemented in a run-time package, usually as a set of functions within a
linker library.  Such a package manages the heap in such a way as to abstract
its underlying structure from the programmer, providing a common interface to
heap management on different systems.  However, this @emph{malloc library} must
decide whether to implement a fast memory allocator, a space-conserving memory
allocator, or a bit of both.  It must also try to keep its own internal tables
to a minimum so as to conserve memory, but this means that it has very little
capability to diagnose errors if any occur.

@cindex alloca
@cindex variable length arrays
In some compiler implementations there is a builtin function called
@code{alloca()}.  This is a dynamic memory allocation function that allocates
memory from the stack rather than the heap, and so the memory is automatically
freed when the function that called it returns.  This is a non-standard feature
that is not guaranteed to be present in a compiler, and indeed may not be
possible to implement on some systems@footnote{Some compilers now support
variable length arrays which provide roughly the same functionality.}.  However,
the mpatrol library provides a debugging version of this function (and a few
other related functions) on all systems, so that they make use of the heap
instead of the stack.

As can be seen from the above paragraphs, dynamic memory allocations are the
types of memory allocations that can cause the most problems in a program since
almost nothing about them can be used by the compiler to give the programmer
useful warnings about using uninitialised variables, using freed memory, running
off the end of a dynamically-allocated array, etc.  It is these types of memory
allocation problems that the mpatrol library loves to get its teeth into!

@cindex memory management interface
@cindex embedded systems
@cindex systems, embedded
Beneath every malloc library's public interface there is the underlying
operating system's memory management interface.  This provides features which
can be as simple as giving processes the ability to allocate a new block of
memory for themselves, or it can offer advanced features such as protecting
areas of memory from being read or written.  Some embedded systems have no
operating systems and hence no support for dynamic memory allocation, and so the
malloc library must instead allocate blocks of memory from a fixed-sized array.
The mpatrol library can be built to support all of the above types of system,
but the more features an operating system can provide it with, the more it can
do.

On operating systems such as UNIX and Windows, all dynamic memory allocation
requests from a process are dealt with by using a feature called @emph{virtual
memory}.  This means that a process cannot perform illegal requests without
them being denied, which protects the other running processes and the operating
system from being affected by such errors.  However, on AmigaOS and Netware
platforms there is no virtual memory support and so all processes effectively
share the same address space as the operating system and any other running
processes.  This means that one process can accidentally write into the data
structures of another process, usually causing the other process to fail and
bring down the system.  In addition, a process which allocates a lot of memory
will result in there being less available memory for other running processes,
and in extreme cases the operating system itself.

@cindex physical memory
@cindex memory, physical
@emph{Virtual memory} is an operating system feature that was originally used to
provide large usable address spaces for every process on machines that had very
little physical memory.  It is used by an operating system to
fool@footnote{Well, perhaps that's too harsh a word, but it will certainly seem
that way to a process running on a 32-bit UNIX system with only 4 megabytes of
physical memory, and yet it will be able to read from and write to over 4
gigabytes of virtual memory!} a running process into believing that it can
allocate a vast amount of memory for its own purposes, although whether it is
allowed to or not depends on the operating system and the permissions of the
individual user.

@cindex memory management unit
@cindex MMU
@cindex system page size
@cindex page size
@cindex page
Virtual memory works by translating a virtual address (which the process uses)
into a physical address (which the operating system uses).  It is generally
implemented via a piece of hardware called a @emph{memory management unit}, or
MMU@.  The MMU's primary job is to translate any virtual addresses that are
referred to by machine instructions into physical addresses by looking up a
table which is built by the operating system.  This table contains mappings to
and from @emph{pages}@footnote{The size of a page varies between operating
systems and processor architectures, but they are generally around 4 or 8
kilobytes in size, and are always a power of two.} rather than bytes since it
would otherwise be very inefficient to handle mappings between individual bytes.
As a result, every virtual memory operation operates on pages, which are
indivisible and are always aligned to the system page size.

@cindex swapping
@cindex swap file
@cindex swap in
@cindex swap out
Even though each process can now see a huge address space, what happens when it
attempts to allocate more pages than actually physically exist, or allocate an
additional page of memory when all of the physical pages are in use by it and
other processes?  This problem is solved by the operating system temporarily
saving one or more of the least-used pages (which might not necessarily belong
that that process) to a special place in the file system called a @emph{swap
file}, and mapping the new pages to the physical addresses where the old pages
once resided.  The old pages which have been @emph{swapped out} are no longer
currently accessible, but their location in the swap file is noted in the
translation table.

@cindex page fault
@cindex fault, page
@cindex thrashing
However, if one of the pages that has been swapped out is accessed again, a
@emph{page fault} occurs at the instruction which referred to the address and
the operating system catches this and reloads the page from the swap file,
possibly having to swap out another page to make space for the new one.  If this
occurs too often then the operating system can slow down, having to constantly
swap in and swap out the same pages over and over again.  Such a problem is
called @emph{thrashing} and can only really be overcome by using less virtual
memory or buying more physical memory.

@cindex memory mapped files
@cindex mapping files
@cindex files, mapping
It is also possible to take advantage of the virtual memory system's
interaction between physical memory and the file system in program code, since
mapping an existing file to memory means that the usual file I/O operations can
be replaced with memory read and write operations.  The operating system will
work out the optimum way to read and write any buffers and it means that only
one copy of the file exists in both physical memory and the file system.  Note
that this is how @emph{shared libraries}@footnote{DLLs on Windows platforms.}
on UNIX platforms are generally implemented, with each individual process that
uses the shared library having it mapped to somewhere in its address space.

@cindex memory protection
@cindex read protection
@cindex write protection
Another major feature of virtual memory is its ability to read protect and write
protect individual pages of process memory.  This means that the operating
system can control access to different parts of the address space for each
process, and also means that a process can read and/or write protect an area of
memory when it wants to ensure that it won't ever read or write to it again.  If
an illegal memory access is detected then a @emph{signal} will be sent to the
process, which can either be caught and handled or will otherwise terminate the
process.  Note that as with all virtual memory operations, this ability to
protect memory only applies to pages, so that it is not possible to protect
individual bytes.

@cindex watch points
However, some versions of UNIX have programmable software @emph{watch points}
which are implemented at operating system level.  These are normally used by
debuggers to watch a specified area of memory that is expected to be read from
or written to, but can just as easily be used to implement memory protection at
byte level.  Unfortunately, as this feature is implemented in
software@footnote{The operating system is still considered software.} rather
than in hardware, watch points tend to be incredibly slow, mainly as a result of
the operating system having to check every instruction before it is executed.
In addition, some UNIX platforms only allow a certain number of software watch
points to be in use at any one time, so even if your system supports them you
may not be able to use them with the mpatrol library if there are many memory
allocations in use at one time.

@cindex misaligned memory accesses
There is also an additional problem when using watch points, which is due to
misaligned reads from memory.  These can occur with compiler-generated code or
with optimised library routines where memory read, move or write operations have
been optimised to work at word level rather than byte level.  For example, the
@code{memcpy()} function would normally be written to copy memory a byte at a
time, but on some systems this can be improved by copying a word at a time.
Unfortunately, care has to be taken when reading and writing such words as the
equivalent bytes may not be aligned on word boundaries.  Technically, reading
additional bytes before or after a memory allocation when they share the same
word is legal, but when using watch points such errors will be picked up.  The
mpatrol library replaces most of the memory operation functions provided by the
system libraries with safer versions, although they may not be as efficient.

An operating system with virtual memory is usually going to run ever so slightly
slower than an operating system without it@footnote{Due to the overhead of
having to translate every address and swap in and out pages --- although memory
mapped files will usually be more efficient than using normal file operations on
a system without virtual memory.}, but the advantages of virtual memory far
outweigh the disadvantages, especially when used for debugging purposes.

@section Call stacks and symbol tables

@cindex calling convention
@cindex application binary interface
@cindex ABI
As stated in the section on stack memory allocations (@pxref{Stack memory
allocations}), when a function is called, a copy of the caller's state
information (including local variables and registers) is saved on the stack so
that it can be restored when the called function returns.  On many operating
systems there is a @emph{calling convention}@footnote{Usually part of the
@emph{Application Binary Interface}, or ABI@.} which defines the layout of such
stack entries so that code compiled in different languages and with different
compilers can be intermixed.  This usually specifies at which stack offsets the
stack pointer, program counter and local variables for the calling function can
be found, although on some processor architectures the function calling
conventions are specified by the hardware and so the operating system must use
these instead.

@cindex stack tracebacks
@cindex stack unwinding
@cindex tracebacks
On systems that have consistent calling conventions, it is usually possible to
perform call stack @emph{tracebacks} from within the current function in order
to determine the stack of function calls that led to the current function.  This
is extremely useful for debugging purposes and is done by examining the current
stack frame to see if there is a pointer to the previous stack frame.  If there
is, then it can be followed to find out all of the state information about the
calling function.  This can be repeated until there are no more stack
frames@footnote{A process also known as @emph{stack unwinding}.}.
This is generally how this information is determined by debuggers when a call
stack traceback is requested.

@cindex program counter
@cindex return address
In addition to the pointer to the previous stack frame, the saved state
information also always contains the saved program counter register, which
contains either the address of the instruction that performed the function call,
or the address of the instruction at which to continue execution when the
called function returns@footnote{Also known as the @emph{return address}.}.
This information can be used to identify which function performed the call,
since the address of the instruction must lie between the start and end of one
of the functions in the process.

@cindex MP_BUILTINSTACK_SUPPORT
@cindex MP_GLIBCBACKTRACE_SUPPORT
@cindex MP_LIBRARYSTACK_SUPPORT
@cindex MP_LIBUNWIND_SUPPORT
@cindex libunwind
There are several different ways to perform stack unwinding.  The first requires
compiler support and uses builtin functions to determine the next stack frame
and the return address.  The GNU C compiler, @command{gcc}, supports this but
unfortunately the number of stack frames to traverse must be known at
compile-time rather than run-time.  The second method uses the glibc
@code{backtrace()} function to perform the stack traversal but has a finite
limit on the number of stack frames that can be traversed and does not return
any frame pointers.  The third method requires operating system support, with a
library of routines provided to perform call stack traversal.  Unfortunately,
such routines can be quite time consuming and may require a lot of resources,
but on the other hand they are likely to be very reliable at obtaining the
necessary information.  There is also support for using the libunwind library
instead of such operating system libraries, which will be valuable as libunwind
gradually supports more processor architectures.  The mpatrol library can be
built to support any of these methods, with the @code{MP_BUILTINSTACK_SUPPORT},
@code{MP_GLIBCBACKTRACE_SUPPORT}, @code{MP_LIBRARYSTACK_SUPPORT} and the
@code{MP_LIBUNWIND_SUPPORT} preprocessor macros.

@cindex RISC
A fourth way to perform stack unwinding involves reading (or effectively
disassembling) the instructions that are being executed in order to determine
the size of the stack frame being used and the address of the instruction at
which execution will resume when the function returns.  This can also be quite
a reliable method of obtaining call stack information but is only likely to be
feasible on a processor architecture which has a very simple instruction set,
such as a RISC@footnote{Reduced Instruction Set Computer.} architecture.  MIPS
processors are a good example of this.

@cindex CISC
The final method of stack unwinding requires that the frame pointer and return
address are both stored on the stack whenever a new function is called.  The
chain of frame pointers can then be followed down the stack, and the return
addresses can be read at a given offset from the frame pointers.  This is
usually possible with CISC@footnote{Complex Instruction Set Computer.} processor
architectures that have dedicated call instructions which automatically save
such information on the stack, although some RISC processors also save these as
well.  However, inline functions and compiler optimisations can sometimes result
in the frame pointer being omitted, usually resulting in an inability to walk
the stack.

@cindex object files
@cindex executable files
However, in order to determine this symbolic information, it must be possible to
find out where the start and end addresses of all of the functions in the
process are.  This can usually only be read from object files, since they
contain the symbol tables that were used by the linker to generate the final
executable file for the program.  The object file's symbol tables normally
contain information about the start address, size, name and visibility of every
symbol that was defined, but this depends on the format of the object file and
if the symbol tables have been stripped from the final executable file.

@cindex debugging information
@cindex line number table
If the object file was created by a compiler then it may also contain debugging
information that was generated by the compiler for use with a debugger.  Such
information may include a mapping of code addresses to source
lines@footnote{Generally known as a line number table.}, and this information
can be used by the mpatrol library to provide more meaningful information in
call stack tracebacks.

@cindex dynamic linking
@cindex dynamic linker
@cindex shared libraries
@cindex dynamic link libraries
@cindex DLLs
On systems that support shared libraries, additional work must be done to
determine the symbolic information for all of the functions which have been
defined in them.  The symbols for functions that are defined in shared libraries
normally appear as undefined symbols in the executable file for the program and
so must be searched in the system in order to get the necessary information.  It
is usually necessary to liaise with the @emph{dynamic linker}@footnote{Which is
the part of the operating system that performs the run-time linking of shared
libraries.} on many systems.

@node Threads, , Call stacks and symbol tables, Operating system support
@section Threads
@cindex threads

@cindex message passing
@cindex shared memory
On systems with virtual memory, such as UNIX and Windows, user programs are run
as @emph{processes} which have their own address space and resources.  If a
process needs to create sub-processes to perform other tasks it must call
@code{fork()} or @code{spawn()} to create new processes, but these new processes
do not share the same address space or resources as the parent process.  If
processes need to share memory they must either use a message passing interface
or explicitly mark a range of memory as shareable.

@cindex parallel programming
@cindex multi-processor systems
Traditionally, this was not too much of a handicap as parallel processing was
an expensive luxury and could only be made use of by the kernel of such systems.
However, with the birth of fast processors and parallel programming, programs
could be made to run more efficiently and faster on multi-processor systems by
having more than one @emph{thread} of control.  This was achieved by allowing
processes to have more than one program counter through which the processor
could execute instructions, and if one thread of control stalled for a
particular reason then another could continue without stalling the entire
process.

Such multithreaded programs allow parallel programming and implicit shared
memory between threads since all threads in a process share the same address
space and resources.  This is similar to operating systems that have no
virtual memory, such as AmigaOS and Netware@footnote{Where the kernel is
effectively a single process running all user programs as threads.}, except
that once a process terminates, all threads terminate as well and all of its
resources are still reclaimed.

@cindex threads library
@cindex POSIX threads
Multithreaded programming generally needs no compiler support, but does require
some primitive operations to be supported by the operating system for a threads
library to call.  The functions that are available in the threads library
provide the means for a process to create and destroy threads.  There are
currently several popular threads libraries available, although the POSIX
threads standard remains the definitive implementation.

@cindex semaphores
@cindex mutexes
@cindex re-entrancy
It is always important to remember when programming a multithreaded application
that because all threads in a process share the same address space, measures
must be taken to prevent threads reading and writing global data in a haphazard
fashion.  This can either be done by locking with semaphores and mutexes, or can
be performed by using stack variables instead of global variables since every
thread has its own local stack.  Care must be taken to write re-entrant
functions --- i.e.@: a function will give exactly the same result with one
thread as it will with multiple threads running it at the same time.

The mpatrol library can be built as a thread-safe library with support for
multi-threaded programs.  When this library is linked with your program, only
one thread at a time can allocate, reallocate or deallocate dynamic memory, or
perform a memory operation via @code{memcpy()}, @code{memset()}, etc.  This does
not take full advantage of the potential concurrency in the library, but at
least it will allow the debugging of multi-threaded programs.

The process of making the mpatrol library thread-safe was made more complicated
by the fact that the mutexes protecting the library's data structures had to be
recursive, since some of the functions that the library will call may call
@code{malloc()} and @code{free()} or any other functions redefined by the
library.  If this was to happen with non-recursive mutexes then the recursive
call would result in the thread attempting to lock a mutex that it already
owned.  However, implementing recursive mutexes was only half the problem.

The other problem with writing a thread-safe malloc library is that it must be
initialised before the program becomes multi-threaded.  If the library is
initialised when there are multiple threads running then one thread may be
attempting to initialise the mutexes whilst another thread may be attempting
to lock an uninitialised mutex.  Ideally, the best place to initialise the
library would be at the start of @code{main()} but there is currently no way
to do this other than getting users to explicitly plant calls to initialise the
library in their code.  This is not a very satisfactory solution if all we want
to do is link in the replacement malloc library without any need for
recompilation.

Fortunately, there are some ways to plant initialisation calls before
@code{main()} is called, but they all have some drawbacks.  The first way is to
use a static file-scope constructor in C++, which will then initialise the
mutexes and the library data structures before the code in @code{main()} is
executed.  However, on many systems this will require the final link to be
performed by the C++ compiler that built the library.  That may not be desirable
or even possible in many cases.  Unfortunately, this drawback appears in the
second method, which involves using the GNU C compiler to compile the library.
This compiler has an extension which allows functions to be specified as
constructors which will be called before @code{main()}, but means that any
program which is linked with the resulting library must be linked with the GNU C
compiler driver.  However, many systems are now GNU-based which would mean that
this would happen anyway.

The final way of initialising the mutexes and the library data structures is to
plant a call to the initialisation routines from a special section which the
system will call before @code{main()} is called.  This section is called the
@samp{.init} section on ELF-based platforms, but may exist in another form on
other platforms too.  This has the advantage that the system linker can be used
to link the final program, but a possible disadvantage is that the library may
be initialised too early, possibly before the environment or file streams have
been set up.  You may find that if one of the above methods does not work for
you then perhaps another one will.

@section Library behaviour
@cindex library behaviour

Most of the behaviour of the mpatrol library can be controlled at run-time via
options which are read from the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable.
This prevents you having to recompile or relink each time you want to change a
library setting, and so makes it really easy to try out different settings to
locate a particular bug.  You should know how to set the value of an environment
variable on your system before you read on.

@cindex alignment
@cindex misaligned data
@cindex bus errors
By default, the mpatrol library will attempt to determine the minimum required
alignment for any generic memory allocation when it first initialises itself.
This may be affected by the compiler and its settings when the library was built
but it should normally reflect the minimum alignment required by the processor
on your system.  If you would prefer a larger (or perhaps even smaller) default
alignment you may change it at run-time using the @option{DEFALIGN} option.  The
value you supply must be in bytes, must be a power of two, and should not be
larger that the system page size.  If you encounter bus errors due to misaligned
memory accesses then you should increase this value.

On systems that have virtual memory the library will attempt to write-protect
all of its internal structures when user code is being run.  This ensures that
it is nearly impossible for a program to corrupt any mpatrol library data.
However, unprotecting and then protecting the structures at every library call
has a slight overhead so you may prefer to disable this behaviour by using the
@option{NOPROTECT} option.  This has no effect on systems that have no virtual
memory.

Usually it is desirable for many system library routines to be protected from
being interrupted by certain signals since they may themselves be called from
signal handlers.  If this is not the case then it may be possible to interrupt
the program from within such routines, perhaps causing problems if their global
variables are left in an undefined state.  As the mpatrol library replaces some
of these system library routines it is also possible to specify that they are
protected from certain interrupt signals using the @option{SAFESIGNALS} option.
However, this can sometimes result in it being hard to interrupt the program
from the keyboard if a lot of processor time is spent in mpatrol routines,
which is why this behaviour is disabled by default@footnote{In mpatrol release
1.0 it was enabled by default.}.

@cindex forked processes
@cindex fork
@cindex exec
On UNIX platforms, the @code{fork()} function can cause problems if it is used
to make a copy of the parent process without immediately calling one of the
@code{exec()} family of functions.  This is because the child process inherits
all of the memory allocations of the parent process, but also inherits the log,
profile and trace files as well.  If both the parent and child processes make
subsequent memory allocations there will be multiple entries with the same
allocation indices written to the log, profile or trace files.  This can be
most confusing when processing these files afterwards!  As a workaround, the
mpatrol library will always check the current process identifier every time one
of its functions is called if the @option{CHECKFORK} option is used and will
open new log, profile or trace files if it has determined that the process has
been forked.  If the @option{CHECKFORK} option is not used then a call to
@code{__mp_reinit()} should be added as the first function call in the child
process in order to duplicate the behaviour of the @option{CHECKFORK} option.

@cindex sbrk
@cindex mmap
On UNIX systems, the usual way for malloc libraries to allocate memory from the
process heap is through the @code{sbrk()} system call.  This allocates memory
from a contiguous heap, but has the disadvantage in that other library functions
may also allocate memory using the same function, thus creating holes in the
heap.  This is not a problem for mpatrol, but you may have a suspicion that your
bug is due to a function from another library corrupting your data so you may
wish to use the @option{USEMMAP} option.  This is only available on systems that
have the @code{mmap()} system call and allows mpatrol to allocate all of its
memory from a part of the process heap that is non-contiguous (i.e.@: each call
to @code{mmap()} may return a block of memory that is completely unrelated to
that returned by the previous call).  It may also be required on some systems in
order for the mpatrol library to implement memory protection.

Beginning with release 1.3.3, the mpatrol library now allocates its internal
memory in the opposite way to user memory on UNIX systems that support the
@code{mmap()} system call.  This means that by default, user memory is allocated
with @code{sbrk()} whereas internal memory is allocated with @code{mmap()}, and
this behaviour is reversed when the @option{USEMMAP} option is used.  This was
done to segregate user memory from internal memory, and was especially required
for the @command{mptrace} command's graphical display.

The @option{CHECK} option allows you to specify that every time an mpatrol
library function is called the library will automatically check the freed memory
and overflow buffers of every memory allocation, although this can slow program
execution down, especially if you suspect the error you are looking for occurs
at the 1000th memory allocation, for example.  You can therefore use the
@option{CHECK} option to specify a range of memory allocations at which the
mpatrol library will automatically check the freed memory and overflow buffers.
All other allocations that fall outside this range will not be checked.  You can
also specify an optional frequency at which this checking should be performed.
No such checking is performed by default in mpatrol release 1.4.0 and onwards
--- you must specify @option{CHECK=-} to get the original behaviour.

On UNIX systems, the mpatrol library can also invoke the @command{mpedit}
command to edit source files that show up in any warnings or error messages that
it generates.  This can only happen if the diagnostic message can be traced back
to a specific source line in the program; in many cases this is not possible.
If editing the files is not required, a context listing of the appropriate
source line can be generated instead.  The @option{EDIT} option specifies that
files are to be edited and the @option{LIST} option specifies that a context
listing is to be generated.  These options are mutually exclusive.

@cindex stripped executable file
If the mpatrol library that was built for your system supports reading symbolic
information from a program's executable file, but it cannot locate the
executable file, or you wish to specify an alternative, you can use the
@option{PROGFILE} option to do this.  All this does is instruct the mpatrol
library to read symbols from this file instead.  Note that on systems that
support dynamic linking, the library can also read symbols from a dynamically
linked executable file that has had its normal symbol table stripped.

Finally, a list of all of the recognised options in the mpatrol library can be
displayed to the standard error file stream by using the @option{HELP} option.
This will not affect the settings of the library in any way, so you should be
able to use other options at the same time.

@node Logging and tracing, General errors, Library behaviour, Using mpatrol
@section Logging and tracing
@cindex logging

If you would like to see a complete log of all of the memory allocations,
reallocations and deallocations performed by your program, use the
@option{LOGALL} option.  This provides detailed tracing for each of the mpatrol
library functions, and a full description of the format of such tracing is given
in Example 1 (@pxref{Example 1}).  Alternatively, you may select one or more
types of functions to be traced using the @option{LOGALLOCS},
@option{LOGREALLOCS}, @option{LOGFREES} and @option{LOGMEMORY} options if you
feel that the log file is too large when @option{LOGALL} is used.  By default
all diagnostics from the mpatrol library get sent to @file{mpatrol.log} in the
current directory, but this can be changed using the @option{LOGFILE} option.
In fact, you can also specify a directory where all log files from the mpatrol
library will get placed by setting the @env{LOGDIR} environment variable.

On systems that support it, every log entry also contains a call stack
traceback that may also include the names of the symbols that appear on the
call stack.  If the object file access library that mpatrol was built with has
support for reading line number tables from object files then the
@option{USEDEBUG} option will also try to determine the file name and line
number for each entry in the call stack, but only if the object files contain
the relevant debugging information.  This information will only be available
before program termination and so any call stack tracebacks that appear after
the library summary will not be displayed with their corresponding file name
and line number.  This option will also slow down program execution since a
search through the line number tables will have to be made every time a call
stack is displayed.  Alternatively, the @command{mpsym} command may be used to
process an mpatrol log file with a debugger in order to obtain symbol names and
source level information for any call stacks.

Because the @code{alloca()}, @code{strdupa()} and @code{strndupa()} functions
automatically free their allocations when the calling function returns, the log
entries for these types of memory allocation are slightly different.  The actual
memory allocation will have an entry similar to @code{malloc()}, etc.@:, but the
memory deallocation will be marked as being done by @code{alloca()} and will
occur at the next call to an mpatrol library function after the calling function
has returned.  However, any such allocations that are explicitly deallocated
with the @code{dealloca()} function will be marked as being done by
@code{dealloca()}.

@cindex library settings
@cindex settings
@cindex library statistics
@cindex statistics
The mpatrol library will always try to display as much useful information as
possible in this log file, and will always display a summary of library settings
and statistics when your program terminates successfully.  If you don't get this
then your program did not call @code{exit()} and either called @code{abort()} or
was terminated by the operating system instead.  In such cases, either use a
debugger to see where your program crashed or use the @option{LOGALL} option to
see the last successful library call in the log file so that you have a rough
idea of where your program crashed.

@cindex memory map
@cindex map of memory
@cindex symbol summary
It is also possible to get mpatrol to write more summary information to the log
file after it writes out its settings and statistics at program termination.
Use the @option{SHOWFREED} and @option{SHOWUNFREED} options to display a list of
freed and unfreed memory allocations.  The former will only be displayed if the
@option{NOFREE} option is used, but the latter can be useful for detecting
memory leaks.  The @option{SHOWFREE} option can be used to display a summary of
any free memory blocks.

The @option{SHOWMAP} option will display a memory map of the heap that was valid
when the process terminated, and the @option{SHOWSYMBOLS} option will display
any symbolic information that the mpatrol library managed to obtain from any
executable files and libraries that were relevant to the program being tested.
All of the above five options can be selected with the @option{SHOWALL} option.

For the purpose of detecting memory leaks, you can instruct the mpatrol library
to automatically log every memory allocation event into a special hash table
called the leak table with the @option{LEAKTABLE} option.  This option will then
cause the mpatrol library to display a sorted summary of all of the memory leaks
or unfreed memory allocations to the mpatrol log file when the program
terminates.  The leak table is indexed by the source file and line number where
memory allocation events occur, but if this information is not available then
either the function name or the return address will be used instead.  Note that
this option differs from the @option{SHOWUNFREED} option in that it will
summarise where the leaks came from rather than show the full details of each
individual unfreed memory allocation.

Because the log file can contain verbose information about memory allocations,
reallocations, deallocations and operations, it can end up being too large if
all such information is being logged for a large program.  To get around this,
it is possible to @emph{trace} all memory allocation, reallocation and
deallocation events in a concise way, to be stored in a separate file for later
processing by the @command{mptrace} command.  By default, no such tracing is
performed but it can be enabled with the @option{TRACE} option.  The default
tracing output file is @file{mpatrol.trace}, but this can be changed using the
@option{TRACEFILE} option.  As with the @option{LOGFILE} option, you can also
specify a directory where all tracing output files from the mpatrol library will
get placed by setting the @env{TRACEDIR} environment variable.

@node General errors, Overwrites and underwrites, Logging and tracing, Using mpatrol
@section General errors
@cindex general errors

By default, the mpatrol library follows the guidelines for ANSI C and C++
regarding the behaviour of the dynamic memory allocation and memory operation
functions it replaces.  This means that calling @code{malloc()} with a size of
zero is allowed, for example.  However, warnings can be generated for all of
these types of calls by using the @option{CHECKALL} option.  The
@option{CHECKALLOCS} option warns only about calls to @code{malloc()} and
similar functions with a size of zero, the @option{CHECKREALLOCS} option warns
only about calls to @code{realloc()} and similar functions with either a null
pointer or a size of zero, and the @option{CHECKFREES} option warns only about
calls to @code{free()} and similar functions with a null pointer.  The
@option{CHECKMEMORY} option gives a warning if a zero-size memory operation is
performed or an error if a memory operation is performed on a @samp{NULL}
pointer --- this is normally allowed by default.

@cindex allocation byte
@cindex free byte
All newly-allocated memory can be pre-filled with a specified byte by using the
@option{ALLOCBYTE} option.  This can be used to catch out code that expects
newly-allocated memory to be zeroed, although this option will have no effect on
memory that was allocated with @code{calloc()}.  All free memory can also be
pre-filled with a different specified byte by using the @option{FREEBYTE}
option.  This will catch out code that expects to be able to use the contents of
freed memory.  Note that you may wish to change these options from their default
values on your system so that the contents can be filled with values that are
least likely to be used at run-time.  For example, ensuring that the pointer
representation of the value can never be a valid pointer, or that the floating
point representation will always be invalid.  These values will vary across
operating systems and processor architectures.

@cindex prevent freeing memory
@cindex free memory
@cindex freed memory
Alternatively, the mpatrol library can be instructed to keep all (or a certain
number of recent) freed memory allocations so that its diagnostics can be
clearer about which freed allocation a piece of code is erroneously trying to
access.  This is controlled with the @option{NOFREE} option, which accepts an
argument specifying the maximum number of recently-freed memory allocations to
prevent being reused.  If the argument is zero then all freed memory allocations
will be immediately reused by the mpatrol library.  If the argument is non-zero
then the mpatrol library will use up more memory than usual since it has to keep
all of the freed memory allocations lying around until their lifetime has
expired.  Note that this option distinguishes between @emph{free} memory and
@emph{freed} memory.  @emph{Free} memory is unallocated memory that has been
taken from the system heap.  @emph{Freed} memory is a freed memory allocation,
with all of the original details of the allocation preserved.

@cindex preserve freed contents
Normally, the @option{NOFREE} option will fill the freed allocation with the
free byte so that any code that accesses it will hopefully fall over.  However,
the original contents can be preserved using the @option{PRESERVE} option in
case you need to see what the contents were just before it was freed.  The
@option{NOFREE} option is also affected by the @option{PAGEALLOC} option, since
then the freed allocation will have its contents both read and write protected
so that nothing can access them.  If the @option{PRESERVE} option is used in
this case then the freed allocation will only be made write-protected so that
the original contents can be read from but not written to.

Note that if the argument specified with the @option{NOFREE} option is non-zero
then the mpatrol library will store all recently-freed memory allocations in a
queue.  Once the queue has filled to the point specified with the
@option{NOFREE} option then all subsequent calls to free memory will result in
the most recently-freed memory allocation being placed at the end of the queue
and the freed memory allocation at the beginning of the queue will be returned
to the free memory pool for later reuse.  Obviously, the larger the freed queue
size, the better chance of detecting attempts to access previously-freed memory,
but unfortunately more memory will be used up and the mpatrol library will have
to keep track of a larger number of memory allocations.

@node Overwrites and underwrites, Using with a debugger, General errors, Using mpatrol
@section Overwrites and underwrites
@cindex overwrites
@cindex underwrites

Once a block of memory has been allocated, it is imperative that the program
does not attempt to write any data past the end of the block or write any data
just before the beginning of the block.  Even writing a single byte just beyond
the end of an allocation or just before the beginning of an allocation can cause
havoc.  This is because most malloc libraries store the details of the allocated
block in the first few words before the beginning of the block, such as its size
and a pointer to the next block.  The mpatrol library does not do this, so a
program which failed using the normal malloc library and worked when the mpatrol
library was linked in is a possible candidate for turning on overflow buffers.

Such memory corruption can be extremely difficult to pinpoint as it is unlikely
to show itself until the next call is made to the malloc library, or if the
internal malloc library blocks were not overwritten, the next time the data is
read from the block that was overwritten.  If the former is the case then the
next library call will cause an internal error or a crash, but only when the
memory block that was affected is referenced.  This is likely to disappear when
using the mpatrol library since it keeps its internal structures separate, and
write-protects them on systems that support memory protection.

@cindex overflow buffers
@cindex buffers, overflow
@cindex fence posts
@cindex overflow size
@cindex overflow byte
In order to identify such errors, it is possible to place special
buffers@footnote{Commonly known as @emph{overflow buffers} or @emph{fence
posts}.} on either side of every memory allocation, and these will be pre-filled
with a specified byte.  Before every mpatrol library call, the library will
check the integrity of every such overflow buffer in order to check for a memory
underwrite or overwrite.  Depending on the number of allocations and size of
these buffers, this can take a noticable amount of time (which is why overflow
buffers are disabled by default), but can mean that these errors get noticed
sooner.  The option which governs this is @option{OFLOWSIZE}.  The byte with
which they get pre-filled can be changed with @option{OFLOWBYTE}.  Depending on
what gets written, it might only be possible to see such errors when a different
size of buffer or a different pre-fill byte is used.

Note that you may wish to change the @option{OFLOWBYTE} from its default value
on your system so that the contents can be filled with values that are least
likely to be used at run-time.  For example, ensuring that the pointer
representation of the value can never be a valid pointer, or that the floating
point representation will always be invalid.  These values will vary across
operating systems and processor architectures, but may also vary depending on
the datatypes that you will be expecting to store in the memory allocations.

A worse situation can occur when it is only reads from memory that overflow or
underflow; i.e.@: with the faulty code reading just before or just past a memory
allocation.  These cannot be detected by overflow buffers as it is not possible
using conventional means to interrupt every single read from memory.  However,
on systems with virtual memory, it is possible to use the memory protection
feature to provide an alternative to overflow buffers, although at the added
expense of increased memory usage.

The @option{PAGEALLOC} option turns on this feature and automatically rounds
up the size of every memory allocation to a multiple of the system page size.
It also rounds up the size of every overflow buffer to a multiple of the system
page size so that every memory allocation occupies its own set of pages of
virtual memory and no two memory allocations occupy the same page of virtual
memory.  The overflow buffers are then read and write protected so that any
memory accesses to them will generate an error@footnote{This is a feature that
was first used by Electric Fence (@pxref{Related software}) to track down memory
corruption.}.  Following on from the previous section, the @option{PAGEALLOC}
option also causes free memory to be read and write protected as well since that
will also occupy non-overlapping virtual memory pages.

The remaining memory that is left over within an allocation's pages is
effectively turned into traditional overflow buffers, being pre-filled with the
overflow byte and checked periodically by the mpatrol library to ensure that
nothing has written into them.  However, because of this remaining memory, the
library has a choice of where to place the memory allocation within its pages.
If it places the allocation at the very beginning then it will catch memory
underwrites, but if it places the allocation at the very end then it will catch
memory overwrites.  Such a choice can be controlled at run-time by supplying an
argument to the @option{PAGEALLOC} option.  If @option{PAGEALLOC=LOWER} is used
then every allocation will be placed at the very beginning of its pages and if
@option{PAGEALLOC=UPPER} is used then the placement will be at the very end of
its pages.  This is probably better explained in Example 3 (@pxref{Example 3})
where the problems with @option{PAGEALLOC=UPPER} and alignment are also
discussed.

Obviously, there are still some deficiencies when using @option{PAGEALLOC} since
it can use up a huge amount of memory (especially with @option{NOFREE}) and the
overflow buffers within an allocation's pages can still be read without causing
an immediate error.  Both of these deficiencies can be overcome by using the
@option{OFLOWWATCH} option to install @emph{software watch points} instead of
overflow buffers, but there are still very few systems that support software
watch points at the moment, and it can slow a program's execution speed down by
a factor of around 10,000.  The reason for this is that software watch points
instruct the operating system to check every read from and write to memory,
which means that it has to single-step through a process checking every
instruction before it is executed.  However, this is a very thorough way of
checking for overflows and is unlikely to miss anything, although there may be
problems with misaligned memory accesses when using watch points
(@pxref{Virtual memory}).

Note that from release 1.1.0 of mpatrol, the library comes with replacement
functions for many memory operation functions, such as @code{memset()} and
@code{memcpy()}.  These new functions provide additional checks to ensure that
if a memory operation is being performed on a memory block, the operation will
not read or write before or beyond the boundaries of that block.

Normally, if an error is discovered in the call to such functions, the mpatrol
library will report the error but prevent the operation from being performed
before continuing execution.  If the error was that the range of memory being
operated on overflowed the boundaries of an existing memory allocation then the
@option{ALLOWOFLOW} option can be used to turn the error into a warning and
force the operation to continue.  This behaviour can be desirable in certain
cases where third-party libraries are being used that make such calls but the
end result does not overflow the allocation boundary.

From release 1.3.3 of mpatrol, the library comes with functions that interface
to the @option{-fcheck-memory-usage} option of the GNU compiler.  This option
instructs the compiler to place error-checking calls before each read or write
to memory.  The functions that are called then check to ensure that the memory
access does not overflow a heap memory allocation or access free memory.  This
can be a very useful way to go through your code looking for errors with a fine
tooth-comb, but be aware that it does slow down execution by a large factor.
It also only affects functions that were compiled with this option, so if the
problem lies in a function that was not recompiled with
@option{-fcheck-memory-usage} then it won't do much good.

To conclude, if you suspect your program has a piece of code which is performing
illegal memory underwrites or overwrites to a memory allocation you turn on the
@option{CHECK=-} option and you should use each of the following options in
sequence, but only if your system supports them.  If all else fails and you are
using the GNU compiler then you could try recompiling some or all of your code
with the @option{-fcheck-memory-usage} option.

@cindex debugging

@cindex halting the library
@cindex gdb
@cindex breakpoint
If you would like to use mpatrol to pause at a specific memory allocation,
reallocation or deallocation in a debugger then this section will describe how
to go about it.  Unfortunately, debuggers vary widely in function and usage and
are normally very system-dependent.  The example below will use @command{gdb} as
the debugger, but as long as you know how to set a breakpoint within a debugger,
any one will do.

First of all, decide where you would like the mpatrol library to pause when
running your program within the debugger.  You can choose one allocation index
to break at using the @option{ALLOCSTOP} option, or you can choose to break at
a specific reallocation of that allocation by also using the
@option{REALLOCSTOP} option.  If you use @option{REALLOCSTOP} without using
@option{ALLOCSTOP} then you will break at the first memory allocation that has
been reallocated the specified number of times.  You can also choose to break at
the point in your program that frees a specific allocation index by using the
@option{FREESTOP} option.

The normal process for determining where you would like to pause your program
in the debugger is by using the @option{LOGALL} option and examining the log
file produced by mpatrol.  If your program crashed then you should look at the
last entry in the log file to see what the allocation index (and possibly also
the reallocation index) of the last successful call was.  You can then decide
which of the above options to use.  Note that the debugger will break at a point
before any work is done by the mpatrol library for that allocation index so that
you can see if it was the last successful operation that caused the damage.

Having decided which combination of mpatrol options to use, you should set them
in the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable before running the debugger on
your program.  Alternatively, your debugger may have a command that allows you
to modify your environment during debugging, but you're just as well setting the
environment variable before you run the debugger as it shouldn't make any
difference@footnote{Unless you've linked the debugger with the mpatrol
library.}.

After you get to the debugger command prompt, you should set a breakpoint at the
@code{__mp_trap()} function.  This is the function that gets called when the
specified allocation index and/or reallocation index appears and so when you
run your program under the debugger the mpatrol library will call
@code{__mp_trap()} and the debugger will stop at that point.  If you are not
running your program within a debugger, or if you haven't set the breakpoint,
then @code{__mp_trap()} will still be called, but it won't do anything.  Note
that there may be some naming issues on some platforms where the visible name of
a global function gets an underscore prepended to it.  You may have to take that
into account when setting the breakpoint on such systems.

@cindex single-step
Now that you have set the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable and have
set the debugger to break at @code{__mp_trap()}, all that is required is for you
to run your program.  Hopefully, the debugger should stop at @code{__mp_trap()}.
If it doesn't then you may have to check your environment variable settings to
ensure that they are the same as when you ran the program outwith the debugger,
although obviously with the addition of @option{ALLOCSTOP}, etc.  Once the
program has been halted by the debugger, you can then single-step through your
code until you see where it goes wrong.  If this is near the end of your program
then you'll have saved yourself a lot of time by using this method.

The following example will be used to illustrate the steps involved in using the
@option{ALLOCSTOP}, @option{REALLOCSTOP} and @option{FREESTOP} options.
However, it is only for tutorial purposes and the same effect could easily be
achieved by breaking at line 18 in a debugger because in this case it is obvious
from the code and the mpatrol log file where it is going wrong.  In real
programs this is hardly ever the case@footnote{The other reason that this
program is simple is because a proper example would generally involve crashing
the program, but on AmigaOS and Netware that would also involve crashing the
system --- not something you'd want to do whilst trying this out.}.

In this example, we'll want to use @option{ALLOCSTOP} to halt the program at

So, set @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} to @option{ALLOCSTOP=1000} and load the program
into the debugger.  If you are using @command{gdb} you can now do the following
steps, but if you are not you will have to use the equivalent commands in your

@end smallexample

After setting the breakpoint and running the program, the debugger halts at
@code{__mp_trap()}.  Because @code{__mp_trap()} is a function within the mpatrol
library, you don't want to bother stepping through any of the library functions,
and in this case you can't since the mpatrol library was not compiled with
debugging information enabled.  So, after returning from all of the library
functions, the source line becomes line 16 because that was the location of the
1000th memory allocation.  Single-stepping twice gets us to line 18 which is our
destination.  Note that the file @file{extra/.gdbinit} included in the mpatrol
distribution contains predefined commands which make setting the allocation
index to stop at much easier.

Sometimes it is useful to be able to see information about a memory allocation
whilst running a program from within a debugger.  The @code{__mp_printinfo()}
function is provided for that purpose and takes a heap address as its only
argument.  Using the above example, it would have been possible to print out
information about the pointer @samp{p} at line 17 from within @command{gdb}:

@smallexample
(gdb) call __mp_printinfo(p)
address 0x080620E8 located in allocated block:
    start of block:     0x080620E8

    stored type size:   <unknown>
    user data:          0x00000000
    allocated by:       malloc
    allocation index:   1000
    reallocation index: 0

@end smallexample

@cindex .gdbinit
Some debuggers, such as @command{gdb}, also allow you to define your own
commands for use in a debugging session.  The following example defines a
new @command{gdb} command called @samp{printalloc} which calls
@code{__mp_printinfo()}@footnote{A sample GDB command file for use with
mpatrol can be found in @file{extra/.gdbinit}.}:

@smallexample

@section Testing
@cindex testing

The mpatrol library has several features that make it useful when testing a
program's dynamic memory allocations.  These are features that do not help in
fixing an existing bug, but rather help to identify additional bugs that may be
lurking in your code.

@cindex limiting available memory
It is possible to set a simulated upper limit on the amount of heap memory
available to a process with the @option{LIMIT} option, which accepts a size in
bytes, but will be disabled when it is zero.  This can be extremely useful for
testing a program under simulated low memory conditions to see how it handles
such errors.  Of course, you should set the heap limit to a value less than the
amount of actual available memory otherwise this option will have no effect.
Note that the mpatrol library may use up a small amount of heap memory when it
initialises itself@footnote{Actually, it's not really the mpatrol library that
uses the memory but the object file access libraries since they call
@code{malloc()} to allocate any memory that they require.} so the value passed
to the @option{LIMIT} option may need to be set slightly higher than you would
normally expect.

@cindex random failures
@cindex failure frequency
@cindex failure seed
It is also possible to instruct the mpatrol library to randomly fail a certain
number of memory allocations so that you can further test error handling code in
a program.  The frequency at which failures occur can be controlled with the
@option{FAILFREQ} option, where a value of zero means that no failures will
occur, but any other value will randomly cause failures.  For example, a value
of @samp{10} will cause roughly one in ten failures and a value of @samp{1} will
cause every memory allocation to fail.  The random sequence can be made
predictable by using the @option{FAILSEED} option.  If this is non-zero then the
same program run with the same failure frequency and same failure seed will fail
on exactly the same memory allocations.  If this is zero then the failure seed
will itself be set randomly, but you can see its value when the summary is
displayed at program termination.

@cindex batch testing
When running @emph{batch tests}@footnote{A set of tests that run without user
intervention.} it is sometimes useful to be able to detect if there have been
any memory leaks.  Such leaks should normally be distinguished from code which
has purposely not freed the memory that it allocated, so there may be a certain
expected number of unfreed allocations at program termination.  It may be that
you would like to highlight any additional unfreed allocations since they may be
due to real memory leaks, so the @option{UNFREEDABORT} option can be set to a
threshold number of expected unfreed allocations.  If the library detects a
number of unfreed allocations higher than this then it will abort the program at
termination so that it fails.  All tests that fail in this way can then be
examined after the test suite finishes.

@node Library functions, Leak table, Testing, Using mpatrol
@section Library functions
@cindex library functions

Along with the standard set of C and C++ dynamic memory allocation functions,
the mpatrol library also comes with an additional set of functions which can be
used to provide additional information to your program, and which can be called
at various points in your code for debugging purposes.  You must always include
the @file{mpatrol.h} header file in order to use these functions, but you can
check for a specific version of the mpatrol library by checking the
@code{MPATROL_VERSION} preprocessor macro.  You can check the version of the
mpatrol library that a program was linked with by calling the
@code{__mp_libversion()} function.

Certain mpatrol library options can be set after the library has been
initialised with the @code{__mp_setoption()} function.  This allows you to
override the default options or those specified in the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}
environment variable from within your code.  Not all options can be overridden,
however, since they would require a complete reinitialisation of the library ---
the @code{__mp_setoption()} function returns a failure indicator in these cases.
You can read the setting of any mpatrol library option with the corresponding
function, @code{__mp_getoption()}.

@cindex __mp_init_ functions
@cindex __mp_fini_ functions
On systems that support it, global functions (with C linkage) in an executable
file or shared library whose names begin with @samp{__mp_init_} will be noted
when the mpatrol library first starts up and is reading the symbols.  Such
functions will then be called as soon as the mpatrol library is initialised,
which can be useful if the initialisation occurs before @code{main()} is called.
These functions must accept no arguments and must return no value.  Similar
behaviour exists for global functions whose names begin with @samp{__mp_fini_},
except that such functions will be executed when the mpatrol library terminates.
Note that this feature will have no effect if the symbol table is stripped from
the executable file or shared library before the program is run, and the order
in which such functions will be called if there are more than one is
unspecified.  The @code{__mp_atexit()} function can also be used to register
functions that should be called when the mpatrol library terminates.

It is possible to obtain a great deal of information about an existing memory
allocation or free block using the @code{__mp_info()} function.  This takes an
address as an argument and fills in any details about its corresponding memory
allocation in a supplied structure.  The following example illustrates this (it
can be found in @file{tests/pass/test4.c}).

As you can see, anything that the mpatrol library knows about any memory
allocation can be obtained for use in your own code, which can be very useful
if you need to write handlers to keep track of memory allocations, etc.@: for
debugging purposes.  It can also be useful to have this information when running
your program within a debugger, so you can use the @code{__mp_printinfo()}
function to display information about a heap address if your debugger supports
calling functions from the command prompt.  Note that the textual representation
of the @code{type} field returned by the @code{__mp_info()} function can be
obtained by calling @code{__mp_function()}.

@cindex __mp_errno
The mpatrol library records the error code from the most recently encountered
warning or error in the @code{__mp_errno} global variable.  This variable can be
read and compared with the known error codes listed in @file{mpatrol.h}.  It can
also be reset to @code{MP_ET_NONE} before calling any mpatrol library function
in order to check to see if a warning or error was encountered during the call.
A string representation of the error message corresponding to any mpatrol error
code can be obtained by calling the @code{__mp_strerror()} function with the
specific code.

The @code{userdata} field shown in the previous example can be set for any
memory allocation with the @code{__mp_setuser()} function.  This can have any
value and is not interpreted by the mpatrol library.  It was added for user code
to associate its own data with memory allocations.

The @code{marked} field that is also shown in the previous example indicates if
a memory allocation has been @emph{marked} to indicate that it should never be
freed.  This can only be performed from the source code by calling
@code{__mp_setmark()} with the address of the memory allocation.  Such a memory
allocation can be reallocated but never freed, and will not contribute to the
list of memory leaks.  It will also be profiled and traced as freed by the end
of program execution if memory allocation profiling or tracing is enabled.

You may also have noticed the use of @code{__mp_syminfo()} in the above example.
This function is very similar to the @code{__mp_info()} function except that
instead of looking for the details of a memory allocation at a specific address,
it looks for the details of a function symbol at that address.  This provides
user access to the data obtained by the mpatrol symbol handler, including line
number information if the @option{USEDEBUG} option is supported and used.

It is also possible for you to be able to intercept calls to allocate,
reallocate and deallocate memory for your own purposes.  You can install
prologue and epilogue functions that the mpatrol library will call before and
after every time one of its functions is called.  These can be used for
additional tracing or simply to add extra checks to your code.  The following
code is an example of this and can be found in @file{tests/pass/test2.c}.

output.

@smallexample

@end smallexample

Note that in the above code, the previous prologue and epilogue functions were
recorded and called.  If this is not done then your prologue and epilogue
functions will completely override all others, which is not usually the expected
behaviour.  In case you're wondering what the last four arguments of the
prologue and epilogue handlers are, they are the function name, file name,
line number and call address of the function that called @code{malloc()} or a
related function.  These can be used in the handlers to see where they were
called from.

Along with being able to install prologue and epilogue functions, you can also
install a low-memory handler with the @code{__mp_nomemory()} function, which
will be called by the mpatrol library if it ever runs out of memory during the
call to a memory allocation function.  This gives you the opportunity to use
that handler to either free up any unneeded memory or simply to abort, thus
removing the need to check for failed allocations.  Note that the low-memory
handler also accepts the same four common arguments that the prologue and
epilogue handlers do.

It is also possible to iterate over all of the allocated and freed memory
allocations that are currently in the heap at any point in a program.  This is
done by invoking the @code{__mp_iterate()} function with a callback function
which is called once per allocation with the start address of the memory block
being passed as the argument to the callback function.  Any further information
about the memory allocation can then be obtained via the @code{__mp_info()}
function.  Note that the @code{__mp_iterateall()} function does the same as the
@code{__mp_iterate()} function except that it also includes all free memory
blocks and memory allocations that are internal to the mpatrol library.

Differences in the heap allocations (their details, not their contents) between
a previous point in a program's execution and the current point of execution can
be determined by calling the @code{__mp_snapshot()} function and then invoking
@code{__mp_iterate()} with that snapshot value as its second argument at a later
point in execution.  The callback function passed to @code{__mp_iterate()} will
then only be invoked with the start address of any memory allocation that has
been allocated or reallocated (or freed if the @option{NOFREE} option is being
used) since the snapshot point.  This makes it possible to detect localised
memory leaks very easily, as the following example (found in
@file{tests/pass/test10.c}) shows.

@end smallexample

The @file{tools} directory in the mpatrol distribution contains two files called
@file{heapdiff.c} and @file{heapdiff.h} which demonstrate the use of
@code{__mp_snapshot()} and @code{__mp_iterate()} to find localised memory leaks.
Have a look at these files to see a further example of using these functions,
or perhaps even add these files to your application for debugging purposes.
Note that it is perfectly safe to allocate memory in the callback function used
by @code{__mp_iterate()}, and such allocations can be freed as well.  The only
restriction is that the callback function should never free a memory allocation
that it has not allocated itself.

An alternative way to detect differences in the heap between two points in a
program's execution is to make use of the leak table.  This is a hash table that
stores the number and size of memory allocations and deallocations referenced
by the source file and line number where they occur@footnote{If that information
is not available then the function name or return address will be used
instead.}.  The leak table can be cleared with a call to
@code{__mp_clearleaktable()} and can be displayed with a call to
@code{__mp_leaktable()}, which will display a sorted summary of the allocated,
freed or unfreed memory entries stored in the leak table.  Memory allocation
events can be automatically logged in the leak table by calling
@code{__mp_startleaktable()} but this behaviour can be disabled by calling
@code{__mp_stopleaktable()}.  Additional entries can be manually added to the
leak table with @code{__mp_addallocentry()} and @code{__mp_addfreeentry()}.

If you wish to write your own diagnostics to the mpatrol log file from within
your source code then you can do so with the @code{__mp_printf()} and
@code{__mp_vprintf()} functions, which are the functional equivalents of
@code{printf()} and @code{vprintf()}.  They prefix every line written to the
log file with @samp{>}, partly for making it clear where user diagnostics occur
and partly to avoid problems with external utilities that parse the mpatrol log
file.  The @code{__mp_locprintf()} and @code{__mp_vlocprintf()} functions are
equivalent functions that also display the source file and line number from
where they were called along with a stack trace, if available.

It is also possible to write out a memory dump in hexadecimal format, a stack
trace at the current point in execution and details of a memory allocation to
the log file in standard format using the @code{__mp_logmemory()},
@code{__mp_logstack()} and @code{__mp_logaddr()} functions respectively.

You can also take advantage of the @command{mpedit} command from within the
mpatrol library with the @code{__mp_edit()}, @code{__mp_list()} and
@code{__mp_view()} functions.  The first invokes a text editor on a specified
file and line number, while the second displays a context listing of a file at a
given line number.  The third function performs either or neither depending on
the setting of the @option{EDIT} or @option{LIST} options.

Finally, there are four functions which affect the mpatrol library globally.
The first, @code{__mp_check()}, allows you to force an internal check of the
mpatrol library's data structures at any point during program execution and also
to free up any out of scope memory allocations made by the @code{alloca()}
family of functions.  The @code{__mp_memorymap()} function allows you to force
the generation of a memory map at any point in your program, in much the same
way as it would normally be displayed at the end of program execution if the
@option{SHOWMAP} option was used.  The @code{__mp_summary()} function writes
library statistics to the mpatrol log file, while the @code{__mp_stats()}
function fills in a data structure with selected statistics for examination in
user code.

@section Leak table
@cindex leak table

@cindex hash table
The mpatrol library provides a hash table called a @emph{leak table} that can be
used to record memory allocations and deallocations for the purpose of detecting
memory leaks.  It can be fully controlled from the source code of a program by
calling the appropriate mpatrol library functions, but the mpatrol library can
also be instructed to automatically enter the details of each memory event into
the leak table by using the @option{LEAKTABLE} option.

The leak table records a flat profile of memory allocation behaviour between two
points in a program and is keyed by source file location.  What that means is,
it contains an entry for each source file and line number that allocated memory,
and if more than one memory allocation event occurred at that point then the
entry will summarise the total events that occurred at that point.  In many
cases, the source file and line number is not available for a memory allocation
event, in which case either the function name or the return address can be used
instead.

The following example shows the use of the leak table manipulation functions.

Line 15 of the above program clears the leak table.  This can be done as many
times as necessary during the execution of the program, but note that there is
only one leak table so this will affect the @option{LEAKTABLE} option.  The
following 6 lines then add matching allocation and deallocation entries to the
leak table corresponding to a source location of line 1 in a file called
@file{file.c}.  Any deallocation entries must match the source position of the
original allocation due to the nature of the leak table.  Note that these 6
lines correspond to an allocation of 1 byte, followed by two reallocations of
2 and 3 bytes respectively, followed by a final deallocation.

Lines 22-23 allocate 8 bytes from a function called @code{function()} but only
free 4 bytes, resulting in a memory leak of 4 bytes.  Lines 24-25 do the same
but allocate 16 bytes and free 12.  The next line allocates 8 bytes from a
code address of @samp{0x40000000} but does not free it, resulting in a memory
leak of 8 bytes.  Note that if the line number is specified as @samp{0} then
the filename will be taken as a function name, and if the filename is specified
as @samp{NULL} then the line number will be taken as a return address.  If
neither are specified then the number of bytes will be added or subtracted from
the @samp{unknown} location.

Line 27 instructs mpatrol to automatically record any subsequent memory
allocation events in the leak table, while line 34 does the opposite.  The
@code{__mp_startleaktable()} function returns @samp{1} if automatic leak table
recording was turned on and @samp{0} otherwise, so we check in line 33 to see if
we should turn off automatic recording by examining the previous state.  Lines
28-32 allocate, reallocate and free some memory just to demonstrate this.

Finally, lines 35-40 display the contents of the memory leak table that have
been recorded since the call to @code{__mp_clearleaktable()}.  Three different
types of display can be generated: allocated memory allocations, freed memory
allocations and unfreed memory allocations.  They can also be sorted by the
total number of calls instead of the total number of bytes (@code{MP_LT_COUNTS})
or in reverse order with the smallest first (@code{MP_LT_BOTTOM}).  The count of
@samp{0} in the last table indicates that there were a matching number of calls
to allocate and free memory within @code{function()} but the number of bytes
freed was less than the number of bytes allocated.  This can only happen if
the entries were added by @code{__mp_addallocentry()} and
@code{__mp_addfreeentry()} and is usually an indication that something is wrong
when making these calls.

The leak table is a useful tool to manipulate when debugging your application
to check for memory leaks, but it is not as detailed as full memory allocation
profiling which is controlled by the @option{PROF} option.  It is probably
better at summarising unfreed allocations than the @option{SHOWUNFREED} option
but does not show the call stack for each allocation.

In addition, the @code{__mp_iterate()} function can be used within user code to
obtain details about changes in the heap since a certain point in a program's
execution.  However, it can only provide details about freed memory allocations
if the @option{NOFREE} option is used.  The leak table will provide less details
on freed memory allocations but its advantage is that it does not require the
use of the @option{NOFREE} option.

@node Tools, Utilities, Using mpatrol, Top
@chapter Tools
@cindex tools
@cindex extensions

The @file{tools} directory that comes with the mpatrol distribution contains the
source code for tools that are built on top of the mpatrol library.  The
functions that are defined in these files are intended to be useful for specific
applications as well as providing real-world examples of how to extend mpatrol.
If you wish to use one of the source files in the @file{tools} directory then
you should first compile it and then link it into your program along with the
mpatrol library.

Alternatively, if you've already installed mpatrol on your system then there
should be an @file{mpatrol} subdirectory within the include directory where
@file{mpatrol.h} is installed that contains all of the header files in the
@file{tools} directory.  There should also be a libmptools library within the
library directory where libmpatrol is installed that contains an object file for
each of the source files in the @file{tools} directory.  You can then make use
of a particular tool by including its header file from the @file{mpatrol}
include subdirectory and then linking with the libmptools library.

If you've written a useful extension to mpatrol then you might wish to submit
it for inclusion in the next release of mpatrol.  Even if it's just for a
specific application, there might be other users out there that may benefit
from it.  You'll even get a credit in the manual!  Note that any documentation
should also be written in the associated header file.

@section Dbmalloc-compatible functions
@cindex Dbmalloc

This file provides Dbmalloc@footnote{Dbmalloc is copyright @copyright{}
1990-1992 Conor P. Cahill.}-compatible functions which are built on top of the
mpatrol library.  They are compatible with the last known public release of
Dbmalloc (patch level 14), but only the Dbmalloc-specific functions are defined
here, leaving the overriding of standard functions up to the mpatrol library.
As the mpatrol library does not currently override the C library string
functions and the X toolkit heap allocation functions, neither does this file.

The @code{dbmallopt()} function does not support the setting of all of the
Dbmalloc options.  In fact, most of them do not make sense when applied to the
mpatrol library.  Some of them have slightly changed behaviour due to the
mapping process and some of them cannot be implemented due to the mpatrol
library having been initialised beforehand.

The @code{malloc_dump()} function does not support the full recognition of the
@option{MALLOC_DETAIL} option in that it does not display the additional columns
and summary that the Dbmalloc library does.  This is because this would make no
sense when applied to the mpatrol library, but it does still affect whether
freed allocations are shown in the listing (although the details for such
allocations are slightly different, and there are no entries displayed for free
memory blocks).

The output for the @code{malloc_dump()} and @code{malloc_list()} functions is
almost identical to that of the Dbmalloc library except for a slight change in
the pointer format when displaying the address of each memory allocation.  The
stack information is obtained differently as well, since the mpatrol library
records symbolic stack tracebacks for each memory allocation.  As a result,
@code{malloc_enter()} and @code{malloc_leave()} do nothing and the return
address in a stack frame is displayed if no associated symbol name, file and
line number could be determined.  Parentheses are not printed at the end of
symbol names so that they can be processed properly by a C++ demangler if
necessary.  Passing a file descriptor of @samp{0} to @code{malloc_dump()} or
@code{malloc_list()} results in the output being sent to the mpatrol log file.

The @code{malloc_size()} and @code{malloc_mark()} functions do not give an error
message if the pointer passed in does not correspond to a heap allocation.
Neither of these functions automatically perform an integrity check of the
heap.  Note that the @code{malloc_chain_check()} function will never return a
non-zero value --- it always terminates with an error message in the mpatrol log
file whenever it detects heap corruption.  As a result, the
@code{malloc_abort()} function is not used.

This file is initialised via the mpatrol library's initialiser function feature,
which means that if the @code{__mp_init_dbmalloc()} function is noted by the
mpatrol symbol manager then it will be called when the mpatrol library is being
initialised.  If this feature is not supported then the @code{dbmallinit()}
function must be called as early on as possible, otherwise this file will not be
initialised until one of its functions are called.

@node dmalloc, heapdiff, dbmalloc, Tools
@section Dmalloc-compatible functions
@cindex Dmalloc

This file provides Dmalloc@footnote{Dmalloc is copyright @copyright{}
1992-2001 Gray Watson.}-compatible functions which are built on top of the
mpatrol library.  They are compatible with the 4.8.2 release of Dmalloc, but
only the Dmalloc-specific functions are defined here, leaving the overriding of
standard functions up to the mpatrol library.  As the mpatrol library does not
currently override the C library string functions, neither does this file.  In
addition, the Dmalloc distribution comes with definitions for
@code{xmemalign()}, @code{xvalloc()} and @code{xrecalloc()}, neither of which
are defined by this file or by the mpatrol library.

This module is intended to work with the existing @command{dmalloc} command,
which sets the contents of the @env{DMALLOC_OPTIONS} environment variable
according to any specified command line options.  The four documented Dmalloc
global variables are also defined, although the two address variables are not
acted upon and changing the @code{dmalloc_logpath} variable has no effect yet.
The @code{dmalloc_errno} variable is mapped onto the @code{__mp_errno} variable
and so the @code{dmalloc_strerror()} function always returns strings that are
specific to the mpatrol library.  Note that unlike the actual Dmalloc library,
this file is not threadsafe, and the @option{lockon} option has no effect.  In
addition, the @code{start} option ignores the @samp{file:line} syntax and uses
allocation indices rather than events.

The @code{dmalloc_debug()} function does not support the setting of all of the
Dmalloc flags, although this file defines preprocessor macros for each of them,
something which is not currently done in the @file{dmalloc.h} file in the
Dmalloc distribution.  In fact, many of them do not make sense when applied to
the mpatrol library.  Some of them have slightly changed behaviour due to the
mapping process and some of them cannot be implemented due to the mpatrol
library having been initialised beforehand.

The @code{dmalloc_verify()} and @code{dmalloc_examine()} functions do not give
an error message if the pointer passed in does not correspond to a heap
allocation, and the latter function does not automatically perform an integrity
check of the heap.  The @code{malloc_verify()} function has not been included in
this implementation since it is functionally identical to
@code{dmalloc_verify()}.  Note that the @code{dmalloc_verify()} function will
only ever return @code{DMALLOC_VERIFY_ERROR} if the pointer to be checked is not
null and is invalid --- it always terminates with an error message in the
mpatrol log file whenever the pointer to be checked is null and it has detected
heap corruption.

The @code{dmalloc_log_heap_map()} and @code{dmalloc_log_stats()} functions map
on to the @code{__mp_memorymap()} and @code{__mp_summary()} functions and so
have entirely different display formats.  The @code{dmalloc_log_unfreed()} and
@code{dmalloc_log_changed()} functions have similar display formats to the
original Dmalloc library, but the summary tables are displayed differently and
will display symbol names if they are available and filename and line number
information isn't.  The @code{dmalloc_message()} and @code{dmalloc_vmessage()}
functions write tracing to the mpatrol log file prefixed by three fields of
optional information, which can be controlled by the @samp{LOG_*} macros when
building this module.

This file is initialised via the mpatrol library's initialiser function feature,
which means that if the @code{__mp_init_dmalloc()} function is noted by the
mpatrol symbol manager then it will be called when the mpatrol library is being
initialised.  If this feature is not supported then the @code{dmalloc_init()}
function must be called as early on as possible, otherwise this file will not be
initialised until one of its functions are called.

@node heapdiff, mgauge, dmalloc, Tools
@section Determining heap differences
@cindex heapdiff

This file defines @code{heapdiffstart()} and @code{heapdiffend()}, which must be
called in matching pairs.  They both take a @code{heapdiff} object as their
first parameter, which must still be in scope when the matching call to
@code{heapdiffend()} is made.  The @code{heapdiff} object is initialised at the
call to @code{heapdiffstart()} and is finalised when @code{heapdiffend()} is
called.  It must not be modified in between and should be treated as an opaque
type.  @code{heapdiffend()} can only be called once per @code{heapdiff} object
before requiring that the @code{heapdiff} object be reinitialised through a
call to @code{heapdiffstart()}.

The second parameter to @code{heapdiffstart()} specifies a set of flags that can
be used to control what is written to the mpatrol log.  A list of all unfreed
memory allocations can be logged with the @code{HD_UNFREED} flag and a list of
all freed memory allocations can be logged with the @code{HD_FREED} flag,
although the latter makes use of the @option{NOFREE} option and can incur a
large performance and space penalty, and also relies on the @option{NOFREE}
option being unmodified between the calls to @code{heapdiffstart()} and
@code{heapdiffend()}.  Note that marked allocations are not normally logged but
this can be changed by adding the @code{HD_MARKED} flag.

By default, only a minimal amount of detail is logged for each allocation, but
this can be changed with the @code{HD_FULL} flag to log full details for each
allocation.  If the filename and line number for an allocation is known and the
@option{EDIT} or @option{LIST} option is being used then using @code{HD_VIEW}
will edit or list the relevant source file at the correct line number, but only
if the @option{EDIT} or @option{LIST} options are supported.

If the @code{HD_CONTENTS} flag is specified then the contents of all current
memory allocations will be written to files and then compared with their
subsequent contents when @code{heapdiffend()} is called.  If the heap is large
then this option can require a substantial amount of disk space.  All of the
allocation contents files will be deleted when the matching call to
@code{heapdiffend()} is made.

@cindex mgauge

This file defines @code{mgaugestart()}, @code{mgaugeend()}, @code{mgaugeon()}
and @code{mgaugeoff()} which produce and control a simple memory allocation
gauge in a terminal window.  The gauge is displayed in textual form using the
standard I/O library rather than using a graphics library.  Since it is updated
in real-time, it makes no sense to send the output of the gauge to a file.  Only
one gauge can be in use at any one time.

The first argument to @code{mgaugestart()} is the filename of the file to write
the gauge to.  As mentioned before, this should be a terminal file that can be
displayed in real-time, such as @file{/dev/pts*} on UNIX systems or
@file{CON:#?} on AmigaOS.  If it is a null pointer then the standard error file
stream will be used.

The second argument to @code{mgaugestart()} specifies the character that will be
used to represent allocated memory.  If this is given as whitespace, @samp{|}
or @samp{+} then @samp{#} will be used instead.  The third argument specifies
the number of bytes that the gauge represents.  If the total allocated memory
exceeds this then @samp{+} will be appended to the gauge.  The final argument
specifies the frequency of memory allocation events at which the gauge should be
updated.  If it is specified as zero then all events will cause the gauge to be
updated.

resulting trace files can be processed by the @command{mtrace} perl script which
is distributed with the GNU C library.

support the @option{--help} and @option{--version} options), but a few of the
commands are written as UNIX shell scripts and so will not work on non-UNIX
platforms.  Note that the @command{mprof} command is documented in the profiling

@section The @command{mpatrol} command
@cindex mpatrol command

A command is provided with the mpatrol distribution which can run programs that
have been linked with the mpatrol library, using a combination of mpatrol
options that can be set via the command line.  Most of these options map
directly onto their equivalent environment variable settings and exist mainly
so that the user does not have to manually change the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}
environment variable.

@cindex LD_PRELOAD
@cindex _RLD_LIST
The main option that is the exception to this is the @option{--dynamic} option,
which can be used to run a program under the control of the mpatrol library,
even if it wasn't originally linked with the mpatrol library.  This can only be
done on systems that support dynamic linking and where the dynamic linker
recognises the @env{LD_PRELOAD} or @env{_RLD_LIST} environment variables.  Even
then, it can only be used when the program that is being run has been
dynamically linked with the system C library, rather than statically linked.

The reason for all of these limitations is that some SVR4 UNIX platforms have a
special feature in the dynamic linker which can be told to override the symbols
from one shared library using the symbols from another shared library at
run-time.  In this case, it involves replacing the symbols for @code{malloc()},
etc.@:, in the system C library with the mpatrol versions, but only if they were
marked as undefined in the original executable file and would therefore have to
have been loaded from @file{libc.so}.

However, if a program qualifies for use with the @option{--dynamic} option, it
means that you can trace all of its dynamic memory allocations as well as
running it with any of the mpatrol library's debugging options.  This is mainly
a @emph{toy} feature which allows you to view and manipulate the dynamic memory
allocations of programs that you don't have the source for, but in theory it
could be quite useful if you need to debug a previously released executable and
are unable to recompile or relink it.  Note that if the program being run is
multithreaded then you must add the @option{--threads} option as well.

Note that the @command{mpatrol} command must be set up to use the correct
object file format access libraries that are required for your system if you
wish to use the @option{--dynamic} option.  If the mpatrol library was built
with @code{FORMAT=FORMAT_COFF} or @code{FORMAT=FORMAT_XCOFF} support then it
must be told to preload the COFF access library (normally @file{libld.so}).  If
it was built with @code{FORMAT=FORMAT_ELF32} or @code{FORMAT=FORMAT_ELF64}
support then it must be told to preload the ELF access library (normally
@file{libelf.so})@footnote{A freely available version of the ELF access library,
libelf, can be downloaded from @uref{ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/}.}.
If it was built with @code{FORMAT=FORMAT_BFD} support then it must be told to
preload the GNU BFD access libraries (normally @file{libbfd.so},
@file{libiberty.so} and @file{libintl.so})@footnote{The GNU BFD access library
can be downloaded from @uref{ftp://ftp.gnu.org/}.}.  However, if these libraries
only exist on your system in archive form then you must build
@file{libmpatrol.so} with these extra libraries incorporated into it so that
there are no dependencies on them at run-time.  However, there may well be
problems if the resulting shared library contains position-dependent code from
the archive libraries you incorporated.  The only way to find out is for you to
try it and see.

If you have access to the GNU linker on your system then there may be a way to
convert archive libraries into shared libraries if position-independent code is
not necessarily required for building shared libraries on your system.  If you
use the @option{--whole-archive} and @option{--shared} linker options then the
GNU linker will read the entire contents of one or more archive libraries before
writing out a shared library.  All going well, you should be able to use the new
shared library in conjunction with the @option{--dynamic} @command{mpatrol}
option.

@cindex embedded libraries
In order to build a shared version of the mpatrol library with embedded object
file format access libraries, you must first modify the @file{Makefile} you
would normally use to build the mpatrol library.  At the lines where the linker
is invoked to build the shared library, you must explicitly add any object file
format access libraries that you want to use at the end of the linker command
line.  This ensures that all references to such libraries will be resolved at
link time rather than run time.  You must then edit the file @file{src/config.h}
and remove all of the libraries that you embedded from the definitions of the
@code{MP_PRELOAD_LIBS} and @option{MP_PRELOADMT_LIBS} preprocessor macros.
Finally, rebuild the shared version of the mpatrol library and the
@command{mpatrol} command and see if your efforts were worth it.

Because the @command{mpatrol} command sets the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment
variable for each of the programs it runs, it does not affect the value of the
environment variable for the current process (except on AmigaOS and Netware
where all processes share the same environment).  However, if you wish to use
the @command{mpatrol} command to set @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} in the current
process environment then you can use its @option{--show-env} option to help you
do so.  This option will apply all of the @command{mpatrol} command line options
to the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable and then display its value on
the standard output without actually running any programs.  You can then
manually set the environment variable with the output from the @command{mpatrol}
command.

@cindex .profile
@cindex ksh
@cindex bash
@cindex .cshrc
@cindex csh
@cindex tcsh
@cindex mallopt
If you wish the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable to be set in the
current shell process automatically with the @command{mpatrol} command then you
must use some shell trickery.  The following script excerpts can be found in
@file{extra/.profile}, @file{extra/.cshrc} and @file{extra/.gdbinit} and can be
inserted into your @command{ksh}/@command{bash}, @command{csh}/@command{tcsh}
and @command{gdb} configuration files respectively.  They each provide the
@command{mallopt} command, which takes @command{mpatrol} command options and
sets the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable in the current shell or
debugger process.

@section The @command{mleak} command
@cindex mleak command
@cindex mleak

Another utility program that is provided is called @command{mleak} and is
useful for detecting memory leaks in log files produced by the mpatrol library.
This program should be used if the mpatrol library could not finish writing the
log file due to abnormal program termination (which would prevent the
@option{SHOWUNFREED} option from working), but note that some of the unfreed
allocations might have been freed if the program had terminated successfully.

The @command{mleak} command scans through an mpatrol log file looking for
lines beginning with @samp{ALLOC:} and @samp{FREE:} but ignores lines beginning
with @samp{REALLOC:}, so only the @option{LOGALLOCS} and @option{LOGFREES}
options are necessary when running a program linked with the mpatrol library.
Note that as a result of this, no attempt is made to account for resizing of
memory allocations and so the total amount of memory used by the resulting
unfreed allocations may not be entirely accurate.

@cindex --ignore
This command will also read the unfreed allocations table produced by the
@option{SHOWUNFREED} option in the log file if one is present.  The entries in
the table will be compared with the currently allocated entries and will be
added if not already present.  However, this behaviour can be disabled by
supplying the @option{--ignore} option to the @command{mleak} command.

@cindex --max-stack
The @command{mleak} command can also be instructed to limit the number of lines
of stack tracing information that it will display for each unfreed memory
allocation.  This is controlled by the @option{--max-stack} option which takes
the maximum number of stack trace lines to display as an argument.  If the
number of lines is given as @samp{0} (the default) then there will be no limit
to the length of each stack trace.

The @command{mleak} command takes one optional argument which must be a valid
mpatrol log filename but if it is omitted then it will use @file{mpatrol.log} as
the name of the log file to use.  The @command{mleak} command makes two passes
over the log file so the file must be randomly-accessible.  If the filename
argument is given as @samp{-} then the standard input file stream will be used
as the log file.  Note also that the @command{mleak} command supports the
@option{--help} and @option{--version} options in common with the other mpatrol
command line tools.

@cindex condenseleaklog
Note that mpatrol patch 5 (which can be downloaded from
@uref{http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mpatrol/mpatrol_patch5.tar.gz})
contains the source code to a FORTRAN 90 program called
@command{condenseleaklog} which offers similar facilities to the @command{mleak}
command, as well as the ability to trim and filter stack traces.

@node The mpsym command, The mpedit command, The mleak command, Utilities
@section The @command{mpsym} command
@cindex mpsym command
@cindex mpsym

Another utility program that is provided is called @command{mpsym}, which is
used to parse a log file produced by the mpatrol library and uses a debugger to
append symbol names and source level information to code addresses in stack
tracebacks.  This should be used if the @option{USEDEBUG} option is not
supported on a particular platform or does not work properly with a specific
program.  It will replace all existing symbols and source level information
associated with the stack tracebacks in the mpatrol log file and will display
the resulting log file on the standard output file stream.

The first argument to @command{mpsym} must be the filename of the executable
file that produced the mpatrol log file but if it is omitted then
@command{mpsym} will use @file{a.out} as the name of the executable file to use.
The @command{mpsym} command will read the symbol table and debugging sections
from this file in order to map the code addresses that appear in the mpatrol log
file into symbol names and source level information.  If the executable file
does not contain a symbol table then no symbol names will be available and if it
does not contain the appropriate debugging sections then no source level
information will be available either.  Obviously, if the executable file is not
the same as the one that created the mpatrol log file then the final output will
be wrong.

The second argument to @command{mpsym} must be a valid mpatrol log filename but
if it is omitted then @command{mpsym} will use @file{mpatrol.log} as the name of
the log file to use, or @file{progfile.log} if it can't find that.  The
@command{mpsym} command makes two passes over the log file so the file must be
randomly-accessable.  Note also that the @command{mpsym} command supports the
@option{--help} and @option{--version} options in common with the other mpatrol
command line tools.

@cindex --skip
If the mpatrol library cannot determine the name of a symbol for display in the
log file then it will mark the symbol as @samp{???}.  If the debugger that is
being used by @command{mpsym} also has problems determining the name of the
symbol then you can pass the @option{--skip} option to @command{mpsym} to
instruct it to skip any symbols marked as @samp{???} in the log file.

The @command{mpsym} command currently uses @command{gdb} as the debugger with
which to obtain the additional information about the code addresses in the
mpatrol log file.  It also makes use of several UNIX text processing commands,
including @command{perl} if it is installed, in order to extract information
from the debugger's output and from the log file.  As a result, the
@command{mpsym} command is only likely to work on UNIX platforms or on systems
which have the necessary commands installed.

@cindex mpedit

@cindex editor
@cindex text editor
Yet another utility program that is provided is called @command{mpedit}, which
is used to invoke a text editor on a given source file and optionally jump to a
specific line number.  It is used as a support command by the mpatrol library
when the @option{EDIT} or @option{LIST} options are used but it can quite easily
be used as a command in its own right if properly configured.  Because it is a
shell script it can be easily configured to support other editors, but this
unfortunately limits it to UNIX platforms at the moment.

@cindex --source-dir
@cindex MPATROL_SOURCEPATH
The first argument to @command{mpedit} must be the filename of the source file
to be edited or listed.  If the source file does not exist then the contents of
the @env{MPATROL_SOURCEPATH} environment variable will be used to help locate
the source file, even if the filename contained an absolute or relative path
component.  This environment variable should consist of a colon-separated list
of directory names which may contain absolute paths or be relative to the
current directory; the first directory in the list will be searched first.  If
the @env{MPATROL_SOURCEPATH} environment variable is not set then only the
current directory will be searched.  You can also use the @option{--source-dir}
option to add directories to the search path used to locate the source file.
Multiple @option{--source-dir} options may be given, and each will be prepended
to the @env{MPATROL_SOURCEPATH} environment variable in the order given on the
command line.

@cindex --editor
@cindex EDITOR
If the second argument specifying the line number is omitted then it is assumed
to be @samp{1}.  The text editor will attempt to jump to the specified line
after opening the source file.  The text editor that @command{mpedit} uses is
controlled by setting the @env{EDITOR} environment variable.  This can be set to
the full pathname of the text editor to use or it can be set to the command that
would normally be used to invoke the text editor, but it cannot also contain
command line options.  You can also use the @option{--editor} option to specify
the text editor on the command line instead of using the value in the
@env{EDITOR} environment variable.

@cindex vi
@cindex vim
@cindex elvis
@cindex emacs
@cindex xemacs
@cindex pico
@cindex nano
The currently supported editors are @command{vi}, @command{vim},
@command{elvis}, @command{emacs}, @command{xemacs}, @command{pico} and
@command{nano}, and if the @env{EDITOR} environment variable is not set then the
default will be @command{vi}.  Selecting an unsupported text editor will result
in an error.  However, you can edit the @command{mpedit} file to add support for
your own favourite text editor as long as it supports a way to immediately jump
to a specific line number when it is first started up.  Note that the text
editor must also open a new window to edit the source file so that it does not
obscure any mpatrol diagnostic messages, and if it does not support this then a
new terminal window must be opened for it to use.

@cindex --listing
@cindex list
@cindex context listing
If the @option{--listing} option is given on the command line then the
@command{mpedit} command will display a context listing of the source file at
the specified line number to the standard error output stream instead of
invoking the text editor.  The listing will be annotated with line numbers and
will also show the contents of the five lines before and after the specified
line if possible.  Note also that the @command{mpedit} command supports the
@option{--help} and @option{--version} options in common with the other mpatrol
command line tools.

@node The hexwords command, , The mpedit command, Utilities
@section The @command{hexwords} command
@cindex hexwords command
@cindex hexwords

The final utility program that is provided is called @command{hexwords}, which
is used to generate hexadecimal constants from a dictionary of known words.
Such numerical constants can be used in source files for a variety of debugging
problems, and problems with uninitialised variables are especially relevant
since these special numbers will stand out if seen from within a debugger.  For
example, here are some common (and some not-so-common) 32-bit hexadecimal
constants that can be used as debugging aids:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .2
@item @emph{word}
@tab @emph{hex constant}
@item addedbad
@tab @code{0xaddedbad}
@item allocate
@tab @code{0xa110ca7e}
@item badlabel
@tab @code{0xbad1abe1}
@item baseball
@tab @code{0xba5eba11}
@item codebabe
@tab @code{0xc0debabe}
@item codedbad
@tab @code{0xc0dedbad}
@item deadbeef
@tab @code{0xdeadbeef}
@item deadcode
@tab @code{0xdeadc0de}
@item failsafe
@tab @code{0xfa115afe}
@item feedface
@tab @code{0xfeedface}
@item freedata
@tab @code{0xf4eeda7a}
@item goodcode
@tab @code{0x600dc0de}
@end multitable

As can be seen above, many decimal digits can be used to represent the letters
that they most closely resemble, along with the hexadecimal digits @samp{A}
through @samp{F}.  This provides a much larger selection of words that can be
matched, although the digits @samp{3} and @samp{8} cannot be used due to the
lack of any similar-looking letters.  The digits and their corresponding letters
are given in the following table.

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .2
@item @emph{digit}
@tab @emph{letter}
@item @samp{0}
@tab O, o or Q
@item @samp{1}
@tab I, i or l
@item @samp{2}
@tab Z or z
@item @samp{3}
@tab -
@item @samp{4}
@tab q or R
@item @samp{5}
@tab S or s
@item @samp{6}
@tab G
@item @samp{7}
@tab J or T
@item @samp{8}
@tab -
@item @samp{9}
@tab g
@item @samp{A-F}
@tab A-F
@item @samp{a-f}
@tab a-f
@end multitable

The argument to @command{hexwords} must be a valid dictionary filename but if it
is omitted then @command{hexwords} will use @file{/usr/dict/words} as the name
of the dictionary file to use.  If that cannot be found then hexwords will try
@file{/usr/lib/dict/words} and @file{/usr/share/dict/words}.  The dictionary
file must be a plain text file that contains one word per line, otherwise few to
no words will be matched.

@cindex --match
The words that are matched from the dictionary file can be controlled by using
the @option{--match} option, which sets the type of case-sensitivity to use.  A
setting of @samp{exact} performs a case-sensitive comparison of all of the words
in the dictionary file and the hexadecimal digits, whereas a setting of
@samp{any} does not.  The @samp{lower} and @samp{upper} settings convert the
words in the dictionary file to lower and upper case respectively before
performing a case-sensitive comparison.  The default case-sensitivity is
@samp{exact}.

@cindex --minimum
@cindex --maximum
The minimum and maximum number of letters that are matched are controlled by the
@option{--minimum} and @option{--maximum} options.  None of the hexadecimal
numbers displayed will have any less or more digits that those specified with
these options.  The default minimum is @samp{4} digits and the default maximum
is @samp{8} digits.  Note also that the @command{hexwords} command supports the
@option{--help} and @option{--version} options in common with the other mpatrol
command line tools.

The @command{hexwords} command currently makes use of several UNIX text
processing commands in order to extract the words and their hexadecimal
equivalents.  As a result, the @command{hexwords} command is only likely to
work on UNIX platforms or on systems which have the necessary commands
installed.

@node Profiling, Tracing, Utilities, Top
@chapter Profiling
@cindex profiling
@cindex memory allocation profiling

The mpatrol library has the capability to summarise the information it
accumulated about the behaviour of dynamic memory allocations and deallocations
over the lifetime of any program that it was linked and run with.  This summary
shows a rough profile of all memory allocations that were made, and is hence
called @emph{profiling}.  There are several other different kinds of profiling
provided with most compilation tools, but they generally profile function calls
or line numbers in combination with the time it takes to execute them.

Memory allocation profiling is useful since it allows a programmer to see which
functions directly allocate memory from the heap, with a view to optimising the
memory usage or performance of a program.  It also summarises any unfreed memory
allocations that were present at the end of program execution, some of which
could be as a result of memory leaks.  In addition, a summary of the sizes and
distribution of all memory allocations and deallocations is available.

@cindex GraphViz
@cindex dot
@cindex dotty
@cindex gprof
@cindex graph specification file
@cindex graph
A memory allocation call graph is also available for the programmer to be able
to see the caller and callee relationships for all functions that allocated
memory, either directly or indirectly.  This graph is shown in a tabular form
similar to that of @command{gprof}, but it can also be written to a graph
specification file for later processing by @command{dot}.  The @command{dot}
and @command{dotty} commands are part of GraphViz, an excellent graph
visualisation package that was developed at AT&T Bell Labs and is available for
free download for UNIX and Windows platforms from
@uref{http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/}.

@cindex cycles
Only allocations and deallocations are recorded, with each reallocation being
treated as a deallocation immediately followed by an allocation.  For full
memory allocation profiling support, call stack traversal must be supported in
the mpatrol library and all of the program's symbols must have been successfully
read by the mpatrol library before the program was run.  The library will
attempt to compensate if either of these requirements are not met, but the
displayed tables may contain less meaningful information.  Cycles that appear in
the allocation call graph are due to recursion and are currently dealt with by
only recording the memory allocations once along the call stack.

@cindex mpatrol.out
Memory allocation profiling is disabled by default, but can be enabled using
the @option{PROF} option.  This writes all of the profiling data to a file
called @file{mpatrol.out} in the current directory at the end of program
execution, but the name of this file can be changed using the @option{PROFFILE}
option and the default directory in which to place these files can be changed
by setting the @env{PROFDIR} environment variable.  Sometimes it can also be
desirable for the mpatrol library to write out the accumulated profiling
information in the middle of program execution rather than just at the end, even
if it is only partially complete, and this behaviour can be controlled with the
@option{AUTOSAVE} option.  This can be particularly useful when running the
program from within a debugger, when it is necessary to analyse the profiling
information at a certain point during program execution.

@cindex allocation boundaries
When profiling memory allocations, it is necessary to distinguish between small,
medium, large and extra large memory allocations that were made by a function.
The boundaries which distinguish between these allocation sizes can be
controlled via the @option{SMALLBOUND}, @option{MEDIUMBOUND} and
@option{LARGEBOUND} options, but they default to 32, 256 and 2048 bytes
respectively, which should suffice for most circumstances.

@cindex mprof
@cindex mprof command
The @command{mprof} command is a tool designed to read a profiling output file
produced by the mpatrol library and display the profiling information that was
obtained.  The profiling information includes summaries of all of the memory
allocations listed by size and the function that allocated them and a list of
memory leaks with the call stack of the allocating function.  It also
includes a graph of all memory allocations listed in tabular form, and an
optional graph specification file for later processing by the @command{dot}
graph visualisation package.

@cindex endianness
The @command{mprof} command also attempts to calculate the endianness of the
processor that produced the profiling output file and reads the file
accordingly.  This means that it is possible to use @command{mprof} on a SPARC
machine to read a profiling output file that was produced on an Intel 80x86
machine, for example.  However, this will only work if the processor that
produced the profiling output file has the same word size as the processor that
is running the @command{mprof} command.  For example, reading a 64-bit profiling
output file on a 32-bit machine will not work.

In addition, the profiling output file also contains the version number of the
mpatrol library which produced it.  If the major version number that is embedded
in the profiling output file is newer that the version of mpatrol that
@command{mprof} came with then @command{mprof} will refuse to read the file.
You should download the latest version of mpatrol in that case.  The reason for
storing the version number is so that the format of the profiling output file
can change between releases of mpatrol, but also allow @command{mprof} to cope
with older versions.

Along with the options listed below, the @command{mprof} command takes one
optional argument which must be a valid mpatrol profiling output filename but
if it is omitted then it will use @file{mpatrol.out} as the name of the file to
use.  If the filename argument is given as @samp{-} then the standard input
file stream will be used as the profiling output file.  Note also that the
@command{mprof} command supports the @option{--help} and @option{--version}
options in common with the other mpatrol command line tools.

@cindex --addresses
@table @asis
@item @option{--addresses}
Specifies that different call sites from within the same function are to be
differentiated and that the names of all functions should be displayed with
their call site offset in bytes.  This affects the direct allocation and memory
leak tables, as well as the allocation call graph and the graph specification
file.

@cindex --call-graph
@item @option{--call-graph}
Specifies that the allocation call graph should be displayed.  This is not
displayed by default as it can get very large for even a moderately sized
profiling output file.

@cindex --counts
@item @option{--counts}
Specifies that certain tables should be sorted by the number of allocations or
deallocations rather than the total number of bytes allocated or deallocated.
This affects the direct allocation and memory leak tables, as well as the
allocation call graph and the graph specification file.

@cindex --graph-file
@item @option{--graph-file} <@var{file}>
Specifies that the allocation call graph should also be written to a graph
specification file for later visualisation with @command{dot}.  If @var{file} is
given as @samp{stdout} or @samp{stderr} then the corresponding file stream will
be used as the target for the graph specification file.

@cindex --leaks
@item @option{--leaks}
Specifies that memory leaks rather than memory allocations are to be written to
the graph specification file.  This option only affects the output from the
@option{--graph-file} option.

@cindex --stack-depth
@item @option{--stack-depth} <@var{depth}>
Specifies the maximum stack depth to use when calculating if one call site has
the same call stack as another call site.  This also specifies the maximum
number of functions to display in a call stack.  If @var{depth} is @samp{0} then
the call stack depth will be unlimited in size.  The default call stack depth
is @samp{1}.  This affects the memory leak table.
@end table

We'll now look at an example of using the mpatrol library to profile the dynamic
memory allocations in a program.  However, remember that this example will only
fully work on your machine if the mpatrol library supports call stack traversal
and reading symbols from executable files on that platform.  If that is not the
case then only some of the features will be available.

The following example program performs some simple calculations and displays a
list of numbers on its standard output file stream, but it serves to illustrate
all of the different features of memory allocation profiling that mpatrol is
capable of.  The source for the program can be found in
@file{tests/profile/test1.c}.

After the above program has been compiled and linked with the mpatrol library,
it should be run with the @option{PROF} option set in the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}
environment variable.  Note that @file{mpatrol.h} was not included as it is not
necessary for profiling purposes.

@cindex binary file
If all went well, a list of numbers should be displayed on the screen and a file
called @file{mpatrol.out} should have been produced in the current directory.
This is a binary file containing the total amount of profiling information that
the mpatrol library gathered while the program was running, but it contains
concise numerical data rather than human-readable data.  To make use of this
file, the @command{mprof} command must be run.  An excerpt from the output
produced when running @command{mprof} with the @option{--call-graph} option is
shown below@footnote{The @option{--call-graph} option is only needed to display
the allocation call graph table, which is not normally displayed by default.}.

@cindex allocation bin table
@cindex allocation bins
@cindex bin
The first table shown is the allocation bin table which summarises the sizes of
all objects that were dynamically allocated throughout the lifetime of the
program.  In this particular case, counts of all allocations and deallocations
of sizes 1 to 1023 bytes were recorded by the mpatrol library in their own
specific @emph{bin} and this information was written to the profiling output
file.  Allocations and deallocations of sizes larger than or equal to 1024 bytes
are counted as well and the total number of bytes that they represent are also
recorded.  This information can be extremely useful in understanding which sizes
of data structures are allocated most during program execution, and where
changes might be made to make more efficient use of the dynamically allocated
memory.

As can be seen from the allocation bin table, 9 allocations of 2 bytes, 105
allocations of 3 bytes, 121 allocations of 4 bytes, 21 allocations of 5 bytes
and 256 allocations of 8 bytes were made during the execution of the program.
However, all of these memory allocations except the 8 byte allocations were
still not freed by the time the program terminated, resulting in a total memory
leak of 922 bytes.

@cindex direct allocation table
@cindex direct allocations
The next table shown is the direct allocation table which lists all of the
functions that allocated memory and how much memory they allocated.  The
@samp{s m l x} columns represent @emph{small}, @emph{medium}, @emph{large} and
@emph{extra large} memory allocations, which in this case are 0 bytes is less
than a small allocation, which is less than or equal to 32 bytes, which is less
than a medium allocation, which is less than or equal to 256 bytes, which is
less than a large allocation, which is less than or equal to 2048 bytes, which
is less than an extra large allocation.  The numbers listed under these columns
represent a percentage of the overall total and are listed as @samp{%%} if
the percentage is 100% or as @samp{.} if the percentage is less than 1%.
Percentages of 0% are not displayed.

The information displayed in the direct allocation table is useful for seeing
exactly which functions in a program directly perform memory allocation, and can
quickly highlight where optimisations can be made or where functions might be
making unnecessary allocations.  In the example, this table shows us that 2970
bytes were allocated over 512 calls by @code{new_pair()} and that 922 bytes were
left unfreed at program termination.  All of the allocations that were made by
@code{new_pair()} were between 1 and 32 bytes in size.

@cindex call sites
We could now choose to sort the direct allocation table by the number of calls
to allocate memory, rather than the number of bytes allocated, with the
@option{--counts} option to @command{mprof}, but that is not relevant in this
example.  However, we know that there are two calls to allocate memory from
@code{new_pair()}, so we can use the @option{--addresses} option to
@command{mprof} to show all call sites within functions rather than just the
total for each function.  This option does not affect the allocation bin table
so the new output from @command{mprof} with the @option{--call-graph} and
@option{--addresses} options looks like:

The names of the functions displayed in the above tables now have a byte offset
appended to them to indicate at what position in the function a call to allocate
memory occurred@footnote{If no symbols could be read from the program's
executable file, or if the corresponding symbol could not be determined, then
the function names will be replaced with the code addresses at which the calls
took place.}.  Now it is possible to see that the first call to allocate memory
from within @code{new_pair()} has had all of its memory freed, but the second
call (from @code{strdup()}) has had none of its memory freed.

@cindex memory leak table
This is also visible in the next table, which is the memory leak table and lists
all of the functions that allocated memory but did not free all of their memory
during the lifetime of the program.  The default behaviour of @command{mprof} is
to show only the function that directly allocated the memory in the memory leak
table, but this can be changed with the @option{--stack-depth} option.  This
accepts an argument specifying the maximum number of functions to display in
one call stack, with zero indicating that all functions in a call stack should
be displayed.  This can be useful for tracing down the functions that were
indirectly responsible for the memory leak.  The new memory leak table displayed
by @command{mprof} with the @option{--addresses} and @option{--stack-depth 0}
options looks like:

@smallexample

@end smallexample

Now that we know where the memory leak is coming from, we can fix it by freeing
the string as well as the structure at line 77.  A version of the above
program that does not contain the memory leak can be found in
@file{tests/profile/test2.c}.

@cindex parents
@cindex children
The final table that is displayed is the allocation call graph, which shows the
relationship between a particular function in the call graph, the functions that
called it (parents), and the functions that it called (children).  Every
function that appears in the allocation call graph is displayed with a
particular index that can be used to cross-reference it.  The functions which
called a particular function are displayed directly above it, while the
functions that the function called are displayed directly below it.  In the
above example, @code{_start()} called @code{main()}, which then called
@code{new_pair()} which allocated the memory.

The memory that has been allocated by a function (either directly, or indirectly
by its children) for its parents is shown in the details for the parent
functions, showing both a breakdown of the allocated memory and a breakdown of
the unfreed memory.  This also occurs for the child functions.  If a function
does not directly allocate memory then the total memory allocated for its
parents will equal the total memory allocated by its children.  However, if a
parent or child function is part of a cycle in the call graph then a @samp{(*)}
will appear in the leftmost column of the call graph.  In that case the total
incoming memory may not necessarily equal the total outgoing memory for the main
function.

In the example above when the @option{--addresses} option is used, it should be
clear that @code{new_pair()+20} allocates 2048 bytes for @code{main()}, while
@code{new_pair()+140} allocates 922 bytes for @code{main()}.  The @code{main()}
function itself allocates 2970 bytes for @code{_start()} overall via the
@code{new_pair()} function.

It is also possible to view this information graphically if you have the
GraphViz package mentioned above installed on your system.  The
@option{--graph-file} option can be used to write a @command{dot} graph
specification file that can be processed by the @command{dot} or @command{dotty}
commands that come with GraphViz.  The resulting graphs will show the
relationships between each function, its parents and its children, and will also
show the number of bytes that were allocated along the edges of the call graph,
but this can be changed to the number of calls if the @option{--counts} option
is used@footnote{Cycles in the graph are marked by dashed lines along the
relevant edges instead of solid lines.}.  A call graph showing unfreed memory
instead of allocated memory can be generated by adding the @option{--leaks}
option.
@ifclear EXAMPLEIMAGES
The HTML, DVI, postscript and PDF versions of this manual contain graphical
examples of these options.
@end ifclear
@ifset EXAMPLEIMAGES
The following graph illustrates the use of these options with the above example.
It was generated using the @option{--addresses} and @option{--graph-file}
options.

As a final demonstration of mpatrol's profiling features we will attempt to
profile a real application in order to see where the memory allocations come
from.  Since all of the following steps were performed on a Solaris machine, the
@option{--dynamic} option of the @command{mpatrol} command was used to allow us
to replace the system memory allocation routines with mpatrol's routines without
requiring a relink.  It also means that we can profile all of the child
processes that were created by the application as well.

@cindex driver
@cindex preprocessor
@cindex assembler
@cindex prelinker
The application that we are going to profile is the GNU C compiler,
@command{gcc} (version 2.95.2), which is quite a complicated and large program.
The actual @command{gcc} command is really the compiler driver which invokes the
C preprocessor followed by the compiler, the assembler, the prelinker and
finally the linker (well, it does in this example).  On Solaris, the
@command{gcc} distribution uses the system assembler and linker which come with
no symbol tables in their executable files so we will not be profiling them.

For the purpose of this demonstration we will only be looking at the graph
files produced by the @option{--graph-file} option of the @command{mprof}
command, but ordinarily you would want to look at the tables that
@command{mprof} produces as well.  All of the command line examples use the
@command{bash} shell but in most cases these will work in other shells with
a minimal amount of changes.

@cindex format string
We will use @file{tests/profile/test2.c} as the source file to compile with
@command{gcc} and we'll turn on optimisation in order to cause @command{gcc} to
allocate a bit more memory than it would normally.  Note that use is also made
of the format string feature of the @option{--log-file} and @option{--prof-file}
options so that it is clear which mpatrol log and profiling output files belong
to which processes.

@smallexample
bash$ mpatrol --dynamic --log-file=%p.log --prof-file=%p.out
              --prof gcc -O -o test2 test2.c
bash$ ls *.log *.out
as.log         cc1.out        cpp.log        gcc.out
as.out         collect2.log   cpp.out        ld.log
cc1.log        collect2.out   gcc.log        ld.out
@end smallexample

As mentioned above, we're not interested in the mpatrol log and profiling
output files for @command{as} and @command{ld} so we'll delete them.  We can
now use @command{mprof} to create graph specification files for each of the
profiling output files produced.  You can find these graph specification files
and the profiling output files used to generate them in the @file{extra}
directory in the mpatrol distribution.

@smallexample
bash$ rm as.log as.out ld.log ld.out
bash$ ls *.out
cc1.out        collect2.out   cpp.out        gcc.out
bash$ for file in *.out
> do
>     mprof --graph-file=`basename $file .out`.dot $file
> done >/dev/null
bash$ ls *.dot
cc1.dot        collect2.dot   cpp.dot        gcc.dot
@end smallexample

The graph specification files that have now been produced can be viewed and
manipulated with the @command{dotty} command, or they can be converted to
various image formats with the @command{dot} command.  However, this presumes
that you already have the GraphViz graph visualisation package installed.  If
you have then you can convert the graph specification files to GIF and
postscript images using the following commands.
@ifclear EXAMPLEIMAGES
If not, you can still view the graphs produced in the HTML, DVI, postscript and
PDF versions of this manual, or you can look at the relevant files in the
@file{doc/images} directory in the mpatrol distribution.
@end ifclear
@ifset EXAMPLEIMAGES
If not, you can still view the graphs produced in the following figures.

@image{images/gcc}

The figure above shows the allocation call graph for the @command{gcc} compiler
driver.  From the graph you can see that the vast majority of memory allocations
appear to be required for reading the driver specification file, which details
default options and platform-specific features.  Almost all of the memory
allocations go through the @code{xmalloc()} routine, which is an error-checking
function built on top of @code{malloc()}@footnote{The mpatrol version of
@code{xmalloc()} was not used in this case since another version of
@code{xmalloc()} was originally statically linked into the program being run,
and so could not be overridden.}.  A large amount of memory is also allocated by
the @emph{obstack} module, which provides a functionality similar to
@emph{arenas} for variable-sized data structures.  You'll see extensive use of
both of these types of routines throughout the following graphs.

@image{images/cpp}

As would be expected, in the above allocation call graph for the @command{cpp}
C preprocessor, the majority of memory allocations are used for macro
processing, with a sizable chunk being allocated for reading include files.
You may also notice the dotted lines that connect the @code{rescan()},
@code{handle_directive()}, @code{do_include()} and @code{finclude()}
functions@footnote{You might also have noticed the dotted lines connecting
@code{do_spec_1()} and @code{handle_braces()} in the previous graph.}.  These
show a cycle in the call graph where each of these functions may have been
involved in one or more recursive calls.  The labels for such dotted edges may
not be entirely accurate since @command{mprof} will only count allocated memory
once for each recursive call chain.

The following figure shows the allocation call graph for the @command{cc1}
compiler itself.  As you would expect, it's a bit of a beast compared to the
previous two graphs, and looks very hard to follow.  However, if you look closer
you will notice that the various groups of functions that comprise the compiler
stand out due to their close association with one another.  For example, you
might notice that the functions between @code{cse_insn()} and
@code{get_cse_reg_info()} form a group that allocates 9140 bytes overall.  You
can also see the parser module at the top left of the graph, initiated with
@code{yyparse()}, and the code generator module in the rest of the graph,
initiated with @code{rest_of_compilation()}.

@image{images/cc1}

@image{images/collect2}

The allocation call graph for the prelinker, @command{collect2}, is a lot
simpler than the previous graphs.  There are no cycles in the graph and most of
the allocations are concerned with maintaining hash tables.  Once again,
@code{xmalloc()} and @code{_obstack_begin()} are the two main sources of memory
allocation.

As can be seen, a lot of information about the memory allocation behaviour of
a program can be obtained by creating a visual image of the allocation call
graph.  In addition, different graphs can be produced to show call counts
instead of allocated bytes (via the @option{--counts} option), and graphs of
unfreed memory can be produced to detect where memory leaks come from (via the
@option{--leaks} option).

@cindex profdiff
Although @command{mprof} does not currently offer this facility, a small tool
called @command{profdiff} which reports differences between two mpatrol
profiling output files can be downloaded from
@uref{http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mpatrol/mpatrol_patch3.tar.gz}.

@cindex VAX
Much of the functionality of this implementation of memory allocation profiling
is based upon @command{mprof} by Benjamin Zorn and Paul Hilfinger, which was
written as a research project and ran on MIPS, SPARC and VAX machines.  However,
the profiling output files are incompatible, the tables displayed have a
different format, and the way they are implemented is entirely different.

@node Tracing, Heap corruption, Profiling, Top
@chapter Tracing
@cindex tracing
@cindex memory allocation tracing

In addition to profiling, the mpatrol library also has the capability to
concisely trace the details of every dynamic memory allocation, reallocation and
deallocation over the lifetime of any program that it was linked and run with.
This information can then be used to calculate trends in a program's memory
allocation behaviour and provide details on the lifetimes of memory allocations.
In contrast to profiling, it can also be used to display a program's memory
allocation behaviour in real-time, along with some useful information that can
be displayed in graphical or tabular form.

Only allocations, reallocations and deallocations are recorded.  The intention
of tracing is to gather concise details about each memory allocation event
rather than complete information about some or all memory allocations.  As a
result, the mpatrol log files and profiling output files contain more detailed
information about individual memory allocations, whereas the tracing output
files contain a broader view of allocation behaviour throughout the entire
program.

@cindex mpatrol.trace
Memory allocation tracing is disabled by default, but can be enabled using the
@option{TRACE} option.  This writes all of the tracing data to a file called
@file{mpatrol.trace} in the current directory at the end of program execution,
but the name of this file can be changed using the @option{TRACEFILE} option and
the default directory in which to place these files can be changed by setting
the @env{TRACEDIR} environment variable.

@cindex mptrace
@cindex mptrace command
The @command{mptrace} command is a tool designed to read a tracing output file
produced by the mpatrol library and display the tracing information that was
obtained.  The tracing information is a concise encoded trace of all of the
memory allocation events that occurred during a program's execution, and can be
decoded into tabular or graphical form, along with any relevant statistics that
can be calculated.

The @command{mptrace} command also attempts to calculate the endianness of the
processor that produced the tracing output file and reads the file accordingly.
This means that it is possible to use @command{mptrace} on a SPARC machine to
read a tracing output file that was produced on an Intel 80x86 machine, for
example.  However, this will only work if the processor that produced the
tracing output file has the same word size as the processor that is running the
@command{mptrace} command.  For example, reading a 64-bit tracing output file on
a 32-bit machine will not work.

In addition, the tracing output file also contains the version number of the
mpatrol library which produced it.  If the major version number that is embedded
in the tracing output file is newer that the version of mpatrol that
@command{mptrace} came with then @command{mptrace} will refuse to read the file.
You should download the latest version of mpatrol in that case.  The reason for
storing the version number is so that the format of the tracing output file can
change between releases of mpatrol, but also allow @command{mptrace} to cope
with older versions.

Along with the usual @option{--help} and @option{--version} options, the
@command{mptrace} command accepts several other options and takes one optional
argument which must be a valid mpatrol tracing output filename but if it is
omitted then it will use @file{mpatrol.trace} as the name of the file to use.
If the filename argument is given as @samp{-} then the standard input file
stream will be used as the tracing output file.

@cindex --verbose
@cindex --source
Normally, the @command{mptrace} command will simply read in the tracing output
file and display any statistics it has gathered.  However, it can also be
instructed to display a tracing table which displays useful details for every
event in the tracing output file.  The tracing table can be displayed with the
@option{--verbose} option.  If the mpatrol library was able to obtain
source-level information for one or more memory events then this can be
displayed in the tracing table by adding the @option{--source} option.

@cindex --sim-file
A C source file containing a trace-driven memory allocation simulation program
can be written with the @option{--sim-file} option.  This program will have the
identical memory allocation behaviour to the program which produced the original
trace file.  This option can be useful to use if you wish to determine which
malloc library is most suitable to use for a specific application.

@cindex HATF
@cindex Heap Allocation Trace Format
@cindex --hatf-file
A trace file in Heap Allocation Trace Format (HATF) can also be written out by
the @command{mptrace} command by using the @option{--hatf-file} option.  It
takes the name of the HATF trace file to be written as an argument and writes
out the HATF version of the mpatrol tracing output file given as input when it
is being processed.  The HATF file format is an attempt to standardise trace
file formats for memory allocation tracing, and is being developed by Benjamin
Zorn, Richard Jones and Trishul Chilimbi.  There is a HATF DTD located in the
@file{extra} directory in the mpatrol distribution.

@cindex GUI
@cindex graphical user interface
@cindex X Windows
@cindex --gui
The @command{mptrace} command will normally be built with GUI@footnote{Graphical
User Interface.} support on UNIX platforms that are running X Windows.  This
means that a graphical memory map display of the heap will be shown in a window
every time @command{mptrace} is run with the @option{--gui} option.  This
display is updated every time a new event is read from the tracing output file
and by default uses the colour red for internal heap memory (used by the mpatrol
library), blue for unallocated heap memory, black for allocated memory and white
for free memory.  Options exist to change this colour scheme, as well as the
dimensions of the drawing area and the window.

@cindex base address
@cindex address space
By default, it is assumed that the start address of the first event that appears
in the tracing output file is the base address of the memory map displayed in
the window.  If the heap grows downwards then this assumption will be incorrect
(since nothing will be displayed) and so the @option{--base} option must be used
to specify a reasonable lower bound for the final memory map.  In addition, the
visible address space displayed in the memory map is fixed to a certain size (4
megabytes by default), but this can be changed with the @option{--space} option.
A small delay can also be added after drawing each memory allocation event
through the use of the @option{--delay} option.

The following options are specific to the GUI version of @command{mptrace} and
are read by the X command line parser rather than directly by @command{mptrace}.
As a result they are parsed according to X toolkit rules and do not appear in
the quick-reference option summary produced by the @option{--help} option.  The
application class for setting @command{mptrace} X resources is called
@samp{MPTrace}.

@cindex --alloc
@table @asis
@item @option{--alloc} <@var{colour}>
Specifies the colour to use for displaying allocated memory.  The default colour
is @samp{black}.

@cindex --base
@item @option{--base} <@var{address}>
Specifies the base address of the visible address space displayed in the memory
map.  The default address is calculated at run-time from the start address of
the first memory allocation event in the tracing output file.

@cindex --delay
@item @option{--delay} <@var{length}>
Specifies that a small delay of a certain length should be added after drawing
each memory allocation event.  The delay does not correspond to a specific unit
of time, but experimentation with the length should yield satisfactory results.
The default delay is @samp{0}.

@cindex --free
@item @option{--free} <@var{colour}>
Specifies the colour to use for displaying free memory.  The default colour is
@samp{white}.

@cindex --height
@item @option{--height} <@var{size}>
Specifies the height (in pixels) of the drawing area.  The default height is
@samp{512}.

@cindex --internal
@item @option{--internal} <@var{colour}>
Specifies the colour to use for displaying internal heap memory.  The default
colour is @samp{red}.

@cindex --space
@item @option{--space} <@var{size}>
Specifies the size (in megabytes) of the visible address space displayed in the
memory map.  The default size is @samp{4}.

@cindex --unalloc
@item @option{--unalloc} <@var{colour}>
Specifies the colour to use for displaying unallocated heap memory.  The default
colour is @samp{blue}.

@cindex --view-height
@item @option{--view-height} <@var{size}>
Specifies the height (in pixels) of the window.  The default height is
@samp{256}.

@cindex --view-width
@item @option{--view-width} <@var{size}>
Specifies the width (in pixels) of the window.  The default width is @samp{256}.

@cindex --width
@item @option{--width} <@var{size}>
Specifies the width (in pixels) of the drawing area.  The default width is
@samp{512}.
@end table

We'll now look at an example of using the mpatrol library to trace the dynamic
memory allocations in a program.  As with the previous chapter we will attempt
to trace a real application in order to examine its memory allocation behaviour.
Since all of the following steps were performed on a Solaris machine, the
@option{--dynamic} option of the @command{mpatrol} command was used to allow us
to replace the system memory allocation routines with mpatrol's routines without
requiring a relink.  It also means that we can trace all of the child processes
that were created by the application as well.

The application that we are going to trace is the GNU C compiler, as before, and
we will discard the tracing information generated for the assembler and linker.
All of the command line examples use the @command{bash} shell but in most cases
these will work in other shells with a minimal amount of changes.

We will use @file{tests/profile/test2.c} as the source file to compile with
@command{gcc} and we'll turn on optimisation in order to cause @command{gcc} to
allocate a bit more memory than it would normally.  Note that use is also made
of the format string feature of the @option{--log-file} and
@option{--trace-file} options so that it is clear which mpatrol log and tracing
output files belong to which processes.

@smallexample
bash$ mpatrol --dynamic --log-file=%p.log --trace-file=%p.trace
              --trace gcc -O -o test2 test2.c
bash$ ls *.log *.trace
as.log         cc1.trace      cpp.log        gcc.trace
as.trace       collect2.log   cpp.trace      ld.log
cc1.log        collect2.trace gcc.log        ld.trace
@end smallexample

As mentioned above, we're not interested in the mpatrol log and tracing output
files for @command{as} and @command{ld} so we'll delete them.  We can now use
@command{mptrace} to decode each of the tracing output files produced and write
their contents in tabular form to the standard output file stream, which can be
redirected to a file for later viewing.  You can find these tracing output files
in the @file{extra} directory in the mpatrol distribution.

Note that both the tracing files mentioned above and the examples below treat
reallocations as a deallocation followed by an allocation.  This was the
behaviour in older versions of the mpatrol library and I haven't bothered to
update the files.  However, it shouldn't affect the final outcome in any way.
In addition, as the @file{mpatrol.h} header file was not included by any of the
source files that comprise the compiler and its toolset, there was no
source-level information for memory events.  If there was, the @option{--source}
option could have been used to display it.

@smallexample
bash$ rm as.log as.trace ld.log ld.trace
bash$ ls *.trace
cc1.trace      collect2.trace cpp.trace      gcc.trace
bash$ for file in *.trace
> do
>     mptrace --verbose $file >`basename $file .trace`.res
> done
bash$ ls *.res
cc1.res        collect2.res   cpp.res        gcc.res
@end smallexample

For the purposes of this example we will only be looking at the tracing results
for the @command{cc1} compiler which are now decoded in the file @file{cc1.res}.
If you examine this file you will see something similar to the following.  Note
that the @samp{@dots{}} marks text that has been removed.

There are eight different columns of data displayed by the @command{mptrace}
command when it decodes the tracing output file and displays it in tabular
format with the @option{--verbose} option.  Here is an explanation for each of
them.

@cindex event
@table @samp
@item event
This contains the event number (or time line) for each memory allocation,
reallocation or deallocation (heap reservations are not considered events for
this purpose).  Each memory allocation, reallocation or deallocation increases
the current event number, and this information is used to calculate the lifetime
of a heap allocation.

@item type
This contains the event type for each entry in the tracing output file.  Memory
allocations, reallocations and deallocations are represented by @samp{alloc},
@samp{realloc} and @samp{free} respectively.  Normal heap reservations (that
will be used for memory allocations) are represented by @samp{reserve}, while
internal heap reservations (for use by the mpatrol library itself) are
represented by @samp{internal}.

@item index
This contains the allocation index that is used by the mpatrol library to keep
track of each unique memory allocation, and corresponds directly to any memory
allocations listed in the log file.  In older tracing output files, memory
allocation events that reuse allocation indices represent a reallocation of the
original allocation.

@item allocation
This contains the start address of the memory allocation.

@item size
This contains the size (in bytes) of the memory allocation.

@cindex lifetime
@item life
This contains the lifetime of a memory allocation and is displayed when it is
is freed.  It is simply the difference between the current event number and the
event number at which the original allocation took place, but is useful for
working out how long a memory allocation is valid throughout a program's
execution.  If a memory allocation is reallocated, its lifetime will be
calculated from the original time of allocation, @emph{not} the point at which
it was reallocated.

@item count
This contains a running total of the number of memory allocations currently in
use.  The total is calculated after processing the current event.

@item bytes
This contains a running total of the memory used by the current memory
allocations.  The total is calculated after processing the current event.
@end table

The first few entries in the table show that the mpatrol library started by
allocating memory from the heap for its own purposes before reserving 8192 bytes
for the memory allocations made by the object file access library for reading
the symbols from the executable file and shared libraries@footnote{The actual
allocation events from this do not appear since they were internal memory
allocations.}.  Most of the further internal heap reservation events are due
to the mpatrol library having to store details for all of the relevant symbols
that it could read at program startup.  The more symbols that there are, the
more memory that must be used to store them.  Note that the heap reservation
events are not really relevant to the analysis of the program's memory
allocations but they are used when displaying the heap graphically.

The first few memory allocation events in the table show that several memory
allocations of 4072 bytes are being made along with several more heap
reservations that are needed to store them.  The last events in the table are
mainly all deallocation events of allocations that were made quite early on in
the program.  The lifetime information for these events shows that some of these
allocations were made very near the beginning of the program, while the others
were made near the middle.  None of them were very big and so would not be
occupying much memory.

The statistics that were gathered from the tracing output file are displayed
after the tracing table.  The first group of entries summarise the heap memory
that was used, with the @samp{allocated}, @samp{freed} and @samp{unfreed} fields
showing the total number of memory allocations that were made, the total number
of memory allocations that were freed, and the total number of unfreed memory
allocations respectively.  The @samp{peak} field shows the highest number of
memory allocations (and total number of bytes) that were in use at any one time.
The @samp{reserved} and @samp{internal} fields show the total number of pages
reserved from the system heap for user allocations and internal allocations
respectively, and the @samp{total} field shows the total number of pages that
were used from the system heap.

The @samp{smallest size} and @samp{largest size} fields indicate the sizes of
the smallest memory allocation and the largest memory allocation respectively.
The @samp{average size} field shows the mean number of bytes that was allocated
between each of the memory allocations.

If you were running a GUI version of @command{mptrace}, information about all of
these events can be displayed in graphical form inside a window if the
@option{--gui} option is used.

Areas coloured blue indicate heap memory that has not yet been used by the
mpatrol library (i.e.@: it has not currently been allocated from the system, or
is currently being used by a part of the program that is not being tracked by
the mpatrol library).  Areas coloured red indicated heap memory that is being
used internally by the mpatrol library.  In this example, the reason that there
is so much internal memory being used is that there are a large number of
symbols that were read from the executable file and shared libraries.  The
narrow band of black and white lines at the top of the memory map represents the
memory that was used by the object file access library when it was reading the
symbols.

The large black bands in the middle of the memory map indicate memory that was
still allocated at program termination.  While this is a substantial amount
compared to the amount of free memory, it does not necessary indicate memory
leaks as the memory could be being used right up until the end of the program,
and is implicitly freed at program termination anyway.

@cindex pipe
@cindex command pipe
Unlike memory allocation profiling which summarises all of the accumulated data,
it is possible to trace memory allocation events in real-time as the program
runs.  This can currently be done on UNIX platforms by piping the tracing output
file from the program being run to the @command{mptrace} command, which can be
achieved in several ways depending on the UNIX system that you are using.  Both
of the following methods are equivalent, where @file{testprog} is the name of
the program that is being traced (and has previously been linked with the
mpatrol library).

@smallexample
# This method specifies the standard output file stream as the
# destination for the tracing output file and then runs both
# commands in a shell command pipe.  This has a disadvantage in
# that testprog must not write anything to stdout since that would
# be written out to the tracing output file.  If stdout is not
# suitable then stderr could be used instead if you redirect it.

bash$ mpatrol --trace-file=stdout --trace ./testprog | mptrace --verbose -
@end smallexample

@cindex mkfifo
@cindex mknod
@smallexample
# This method creates a named pipe called myfifo (but it could be
# called anything) and runs the program being traced and the mptrace
# command separately (perhaps in two separate windows).  If the
# mkfifo command is not available on your system then try mknod.

bash$ mkfifo myfifo
bash$ mpatrol --trace-file=myfifo --trace ./testprog &
bash$ mptrace --verbose myfifo
@end smallexample

@cindex xmem
The idea for graphically displaying a memory map of the heap comes from the
@command{xmem} tool supplied with the University of Toronto Computer Systems
Research Institute malloc library, written by Mark Moraes.  However, the
documentation for that tool remarks that it was written as a quick and dirty
hack.  The @command{mptrace} command is hopefully more stable and contains a lot
more functionality.

The mpatrol library can also generate trace files in a format that is compatible
with the GNU @code{mtrace()} option.  The code to do this is built on top of the
mpatrol library and is in @file{tools/mtrace.c} and @file{tools/mtrace.h}.  Such
trace files can then be processed by the GNU @command{mtrace} command.  The
@file{tools/mgauge.c} and @file{tools/mgauge.h} files in the same directory
can be used to implement an allocated memory gauge which updates in real-time
in a terminal window.  This can be used as an alternative to the window used by
the @command{mptrace} command's @option{--gui} option for a simpler display.

@chapter Heap corruption
@cindex heap corruption
@cindex corruption

There can be many causes of heap corruption in a program and there can be many
forms in which it can appear.  This chapter attempts to describe the most
appropriate ways to narrow down and remove the causes of the most common forms
of heap corruption.  Note that errors such as freeing an allocated block twice
are not considered in this chapter even though they would result in heap
corruption in a normal malloc library --- the mpatrol library catches these
special cases so you know exactly where they occur.

The three forms of errors we are going to look at are heap corruption in free
memory blocks, freed memory blocks and overflow buffers.  As you will soon see,
the same piece of faulty code can produce any one of these errors depending on
which mpatrol library options you use.  The following discussion assumes that
you have run your program with the mpatrol library and you get an @samp{ALLOVF},
@samp{FRDCOR}, @samp{FRDOVF} or @samp{FRECOR} error in the mpatrol log file when
your program terminates.  It also assumes that you haven't set the
@env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable yet.

By default, the only times the mpatrol library will check the heap for memory
corruption are when it terminates or when @code{__mp_check()} is called (but
the latter won't be happening since you won't have modified your program yet).
This isn't good enough for errors such as these so we need to instruct it to
make checks whenever an mpatrol library function is called.  The @option{CHECK}
option controls when such automated checks occur, and this can normally be set
to @option{CHECK=-} to check the heap whenever a call to an mpatrol library
function is made.

However, in programs which take a long time to execute, or programs which make a
large number of memory allocations, this can slow the program down quite a bit
so you might want to try the optional @samp{/freq} argument to the
@option{CHECK} option.  This simply instructs the mpatrol library to make the
checks every @emph{freq} calls to the mpatrol library functions rather than
every call.  For example, @option{CHECK=/10} will make the checks every 10
calls, which will reduce the slowdown in the program but will still help narrow
down where the heap corruption is occurring.

We'll use the following program as a running example for the discussions below,
although you'll probably be following them using your program instead of this
one.  It contains a small bug that doesn't normally show up when using the
system C library but causes a @samp{FRECOR} error when linked with mpatrol.

We get the following error in the mpatrol log file when we run with the above
example linked to the mpatrol library.  The error occurs when the program
returns from @code{main()} since that is when the mpatrol library is
terminating.

@smallexample
ERROR: [FRECOR]: free memory corruption at 0x0002A571
        0x0002A571  00555555 555555                      .UUUUUU
@end smallexample

If we run with the @option{CHECK=-} option then the above error occurs at line
24 when the variable @code{i} is 100, which is slightly better since we've
narrowed down where the fault is.

Assuming all goes well, your program should now also terminate at an earlier
point, with the mpatrol library still reporting the same heap corruption error
in the log file.  If not, it could be that the heap is being corrupted after the
last call to the mpatrol library is made, or if you get a different error then
the original heap corruption might have been as a result of the earlier error.
In either case you can still proceed with the following instructions.

If you look at the summary of statistics that were produced in the mpatrol log
file before the error was displayed you will see an entry for @samp{allocation
count}.  The number following it is the number of memory allocations that were
made before the error occurred.  Remember this number because you can use this
information with the @option{CHECK} option so that checks for heap corruption
are only made after a certain number of memory allocations.  However, you'll
probably want to subtract a few allocations just to be sure (or in case you are
running a multithreaded program that does not produce the same allocation count
every time it is run).  That way, you don't need to check the entire heap.  For
example, if the allocation count was 178, try setting the @option{CHECK=170-190}
option so that your program will run at a reasonable speed up to that point
(although make sure that it still gives the same error at the same point).
There is nothing worse than debugging a problem that takes forever to reproduce.

In our example, the allocation count given is 123 (excerpt given below) and
running with @option{CHECK=120-125} gives the same behaviour as when we ran with
@option{CHECK=-} (except that we got to the error slightly faster).

@smallexample
@dots{}

symbols read:      5059
autosave count:    0
freed queue size:  0
allocation count:  123
allocation peak:   8 (11117 bytes)
allocation limit:  0 bytes
allocated blocks:  7 (1374 bytes)

@dots{}
@end smallexample

So we now have the allocation index of the last successful memory allocation
before the heap corruption occurred, and we can safely run the program without
performing heap checks up to that point.  If the error was not @samp{FRECOR}
then there will also be information displayed in the mpatrol log file about the
associated memory allocation that was corrupted.  If the error was @samp{FRECOR}
then quickly try to see if you can convert it to a @samp{FRDCOR} error or a
@samp{FRDOVF} error by also running with the @option{NOFREE} option.  You may
have to use the relevant allocation index as an argument to the @option{NOFREE}
option just in case it was the very first memory allocation that was freed and
corrupted, but remember that the @option{NOFREE} option may cause your program
to use up a lot more memory and so it might be unfeasible to use.  Running with
the @option{NOFREE=123} option in our example has no effect.

One of the most common causes of heap corruption is to erroneously write beyond
the bounds of a memory allocation.  This can corrupt the bytes directly before
and/or after the allocated bytes and can be detected by placing overflow buffers
on either side of the memory allocation with the @option{OFLOWSIZE} option.  By
default, the mpatrol library does not make use of overflow buffers so you have
to explicitly turn them on, giving the number of bytes to use for each overflow
buffer (which must a be power of two) as the argument to the @option{OFLOWSIZE}
option.  In our example, if we use the @option{OFLOWSIZE=4} option, the
@samp{FRECOR} error turns into an @samp{ALLOVF} error, thus providing us with
more information (and also that the heap corruption is due to a write beyond the
end of a memory allocation).

@smallexample
ERROR: [ALLOVF]: allocation 0x0002A5A0 has a corrupted overflow buffer at
                 0x0002A5A9
        0x0002A5A9  00AAAAAA                             .

        0x000135A4 _start+100
@end smallexample

Sometimes it's not just a immediate overflow that can occur.  For example, if
not enough memory has been allocated for a structure variable and then the last
field of the structure is assigned to, the memory corruption may occur much
further away than the few bytes surrounding the allocation.  In this case it may
be useful to try varying the argument given to the @option{OFLOWSIZE} option
since it is possible to convert otherwise unhelpful @samp{FRECOR} errors into
@samp{ALLOVF}, @samp{FRDCOR} or @samp{FRDOVF} errors which describe the memory
allocation that was affected.  Also, depending on the bytes that are being
written to corrupt the heap, you may find it helpful to change the values of the
free bytes and overflow bytes that the mpatrol library uses to perform heap
integrity checks, just in case there are illegal bytes being written that are
going unnoticed when the heap is being checked.  In our example, if the
@option{OFLOWBYTE=0} option is used then the heap corruption is hidden
completely and we don't get an error at all!

Hopefully, we now know as much as possible about where the heap corruption is
happening (i.e.@: the details of the allocated or freed memory block that is
affected, or the free memory block if we are unlucky) and also when it is
happening (i.e.@: after which allocation index).  We now have several choices
on how to narrow the problem down to a specific source line.

On systems with virtual memory we can make use of the @option{PAGEALLOC} option
in order to write-protect a page of virtual memory on either side of each memory
allocation.  This option takes up a lot more memory since each memory allocation
will occupy at least 3 pages of virtual memory no matter how small it is, and on
systems with a page size of 8192 bytes that equates to a minimum 24 kilobytes of
memory per allocation!  However, if that is still feasible for the particular
program that is causing the heap corruption then we can proceed by first setting
the @option{PAGEALLOC=LOWER} option.  That aligns each memory allocation to a
page boundary so that any underwrites occurring before the allocation will be
trapped and cause the program to crash.  This can be caught in a debugger which
will show the exact source line that attempted to perform the illegal write to
memory (assuming it is a symbolic debugger and the program was compiled with
debugging information).

In our example, running with this option doesn't provide us with any more
information since the heap corruption was occurring beyond the end of the memory
allocation and not before the start.  In this case we need to use the
@option{PAGEALLOC=UPPER} option to align the end of each memory allocation to a
page boundary so that any overwrites occurring after the allocation will be
trapped and cause the program to crash.  Unfortunately, using this option still
doesn't help in our example, so what's wrong?

The mpatrol library must align each new general-purpose memory allocation to an
address that allows the processor to access the datatypes that may be stored
there.  This is typically 4 bytes on 32-bit processors and 8 bytes on 64-bit
processors, but a few processor architectures (such as the Intel x86) allow the
processor to read misaligned data at a performance cost.  This is in direct
conflict with the @option{PAGEALLOC=UPPER} option, which would like to align the
end of each memory allocation to a page boundary no matter what the size of the
allocation is.  However, if we use the @option{DEFALIGN=1} option in our example
we can get the desired effect with the @option{PAGEALLOC=UPPER} option.

Running this in a debugger shows that the failure occurs at line 22 in our
example since we didn't allocate enough memory at line 17.  We can also achieve
the same effect on systems that support software watchpoints by using the
@option{OFLOWWATCH} option.  This uses the same amount of memory as the
@option{OFLOWSIZE} option but can run very slowly as every single memory access
is checked by the system.  Note that the @samp{FRDCOR} and @samp{FRECOR} errors
do not occur when using the @option{PAGEALLOC} option since they will become
illegal memory accesses instead.

If you don't have the luxury of being able to use the mpatrol options that take
advantage of virtual memory protection, you can still use more traditional means
of finding the error.

The chapter that describes how to use mpatrol (@pxref{Using mpatrol}) contains a
section on how to pause at specific memory allocation events in a debugger
(@pxref{Using with a debugger}).  Since we know what the allocation index of the
last successful allocation was we can use the debugger to set a watchpoint on
the address of the memory corruption so that it can trap the instruction that
changes it.  Doing this is effectively the same as using the @option{PAGEALLOC}
or @option{OFLOWWATCH} options.  There is a detailed tutorial on how to do this
in GDB in the aforementioned section of the manual.

If the debugger option isn't available to you either then you can try locating
the problem by modifying your code.  You should know where the last successful
memory allocation was made from the steps taken at the start of this chapter.
Using this knowledge, you should be able to work out the range of code that is
causing the heap corruption.  Then you can add calls to @code{__mp_check()} at
strategic points within that range so that you can narrow down where the heap
corruption is coming from.  If you display a unique message after each call to
@code{__mp_check()} then you should be able to narrow it down quite quickly by
monitoring which messages get displayed.

You might also find it helpful to make calls to @code{__mp_memorymap()} so that
you can keep track of the location of each memory allocation in the heap, and
so that you can tell which allocations neighbour each other.  Turning on the
@option{LOGMEMORY} option with the @code{__mp_setoption()} function might also
help you see what is going on if there are a lot of calls to the memory
operation functions.  Finally, if you are using the GNU compiler then the
@option{-fcheck-memory-usage} option might come in handy if you can recompile
the source files that you think might contain the problem.  However, the error
may be hidden behind a call to a library function that is not compiled with that
option, as is the case with our example.

Another slightly less common problem associated with heap corruption is when
the contents of a memory allocation have been overwritten unexpectedly but do
not overflow its boundaries.  This is not a misuse of the heap and so mpatrol
will not report any errors or warnings, but it may be an error in the user's
code.  The heapdiff tool (@pxref{heapdiff}) provided in libmptools has an option
called @code{HD_CONTENTS} which allows the entire @emph{live} contents of the
heap to be written to disk and then compared when @code{heapdiffend()} is
called.  Every single difference (at the byte level) in each memory allocation
is reported and this information can be extremely useful in narrowing down heap
corruption.  However, the @code{HD_CONTENTS} option will require a lot of disk
space if the heap is very large.

To conclude, the mpatrol library contains a wide variety of options and
functions that you can add to your debugging toolkit, but only if you know how
to use them correctly.  Hopefully, after reading this chapter you will feel
slightly more confident about knowing how to slay those heap corruption demons.

@chapter Memory leaks
@cindex memory leaks
@cindex leaks

Memory leaks can be the bane of many a programmer and is the type of error that
can typically go unnoticed in simple test cases.  It is perhaps not until an
application has been released to the customer and is being run in real-life
situations that memory leaks get noticed and become a serious problem.  Luckily
the mpatrol library provides tools that can quickly help detect, identify and
remove such errors.  Note that it's probably a good idea to fix any warnings or
errors that appear in the mpatrol log file before starting to look at removing
memory leaks.

Surprisingly, there are no less than four different groups of mpatrol library
run-time options that you can use to detect memory leaks in a program, all
without having to change a single line of code!  They each employ different
techniques in order to locate the unfreed memory allocations at program
termination and operate independently of one another so that any combination of
techniques can be used at any one time.  They also have differing levels of
detail in the information they provide, so which options you use will depend on
what your requirements are.

If you wish to see a summary of the memory leaks grouped together by call site
then the @option{PROF} or @option{LEAKTABLE} options are your best bet.  The
output file produced by the @option{PROF} option can be displayed by the
@command{mprof} command, which will display a list of memory leaks as one of the
tables that it shows.  Each entry in the memory leak table will normally only
show one level of stack depth from its call graph but this can be changed with
the @option{--stack-depth} option in the @command{mprof} command.  The table of
memory leaks can also be written to a graph specification file for later
visualisation with a graph package.  Using the @option{PROF} option is probably
the best way to summarise where memory leaks occur in a program.

However, the @option{LEAKTABLE} option can generate similar information to the
@option{PROF} option in the mpatrol log file.  The drawback to this option is
that the entries displayed will only ever show the immediate calling functions
and no call stack information, but in many cases this is good enough.  Another
drawback to this option is that it is affected by calls in the code to
manipulate the leak table.  However, if the calls aren't there then that won't
be an issue.  The leak table should really be used from within the source code
(see below) but it can still provide some useful information with the
@option{LEAKTABLE} option.

The third option is the @option{SHOWUNFREED} option, which will show the details
of every unfreed memory allocation at the end of program execution.  No attempt
is made to summarise them, but the full details of each (including the call
stack if available) are given.  This option is really only useful if there are
a small number of unfreed memory allocations when a program terminates, but it
is invaluable if all of the gory details are required.

The final group of options are the @option{LOGALLOCS}, @option{LOGREALLOCS} and
@option{LOGFREES} options@footnote{Note that the @option{LOGMEMORY} option isn't
listed which is why @option{LOGALL} wasn't listed either.}.  In some situations
a program will abort abnormally before it can exit, in which case the
@option{LEAKTABLE} and @option{SHOWUNFREED} options will not display anything,
and the @option{PROF} option will not finish writing out the profiling output
file unless you are exceptionally lucky with the @option{AUTOSAVE} option.  One
can argue that you should be looking for the cause of the error rather than
memory leaks in such a program, but it is still possible to detect the latter
using the aforementioned @option{LOG*} options and the @command{mleak} command.

The @command{mleak} command reads in an mpatrol log file, recording the details
of each logged memory allocation, reallocation or deallocation and then writes
out what the @option{SHOWUNFREED} option should have written out at the end of
the log file.  It has a few limitations compared to the @option{SHOWUNFREED}
option, but the details of each unfreed memory allocation that it writes out
should be accurate, although only if the logging information in the log file was
complete and accurate as well.

Note that more information from the @option{SHOWUNFREED} and @option{LOG*}
options can be obtained by using the @option{USEDEBUG} option.  This will
attempt to add missing source file and line number information to the details
recorded by these options in the mpatrol log file, but only if it is supported
by the particular system and object file format, and then only if the program
was compiled with debugging information from the compiler.  If the
@option{USEDEBUG} option isn't supported then it might be possible to use the
@command{mpsym} command to postprocess the mpatrol log file using a symbolic
debugger to fill in such information.  You may also find that running the log
file through a C++ encoded name demangler is useful as well if your program
contains C++ code.

Despite the plethora of automated features that the mpatrol library has for
detecting memory leaks, the most powerful method of narrowing down such leaks
is by modifying the source code.  The mpatrol library provides several functions
that can be used to keep track of differences in the heap between two or more
points in a program's execution --- such information can be invaluable when
pinpointing where a memory leak is coming from.

The first set of functions are based upon taking a snapshot of the heap at a
certain point and then walking the heap to examine the differences at a later
point.  The @code{__mp_snapshot()} function returns the current event identifier
in the mpatrol library and the @code{__mp_iterate()} function traverses the
heap calling a user-defined callback function for each memory allocation that
has changed since a particular event identifier.  This is very useful for noting
memory allocations that have been made since a certain point in a program but
have not been freed when they were expected to.  The heapdiff tool
(@pxref{heapdiff}) provided in libmptools makes use of these functions to
provide an easy-to-use interface.

The mpatrol library also provides a leak table (@pxref{Leak table}) that can be
manipulated at any point in a program for the purpose of detecting changes in
the heap.  The @code{__mp_clearleaktable()} function clears the leak table,
while the @code{__mp_leaktable()} function writes the contents of the leak table
to the mpatrol log file.  Automatic logging of memory allocations, reallocations
and deallocations can be turned on and off using the
@code{__mp_startleaktable()} and @code{__mp_stopleaktable()} functions
respectively.  The main advantage to using the leak table instead of the
functions described in the previous paragraph is that it can provide a summary
of unfreed allocations rather than showing the details of each one individually.
It can also summarise freed allocations without requiring the use of the
@option{NOFREE} option.

Finally, you can indicate to the mpatrol library that a particular memory
allocation will remain allocated until program termination and that it should
not be treated as a memory leak.  This can be done by calling the
@code{__mp_setmark()} function, and thereafter any attempt to free the
newly-marked allocation will result in an error, although reallocating it is
possible.  It is normal in many programs to make several initial memory
allocations that will remain in use throughout the program's lifetime.  On most
systems, such allocations will be freed when the program terminates anyway so
there will be no need to free them explicitly.  It is these allocations that
should be marked so as to prevent them showing up as memory leaks.

Because of their need to cover every eventuality, malloc library implementations
are very general and most do their job well when you consider what is thrown at
them.  However, your program may not be performing as well as it should simply
because there may be a more efficient way of dealing with dynamic memory
allocations.  Indeed, there may even be a more efficient malloc library
available for you to use.

If you need to allocate lots of blocks of the same size@footnote{Such as for use
in a linked list.}, but you won't know the number of blocks you'll require until
run-time then you could take the easy approach by simply allocating a new block
of memory for each occurrence.  However, this is going to create a lot of
(typically small) memory blocks that the underlying malloc library will have to
keep track of, and even in many good malloc libraries this is likely to cause
memory fragmentation and possibly even result in the blocks scattered throughout
the address space rather than all in the one place, which is not necessarily a
good thing on systems with virtual memory.

An alternative approach would be to allocate memory in multiples of the block
size, so that several blocks would be allocated at once.  This would require
slightly more work on your part since you would need to write interface code to
return a single block, while possible allocating space for more blocks if no
free blocks were available.  However, this approach has several advantages.  The
first is that the malloc library only needs to keep track of a few large
allocations rather than lots of small allocations, so splitting and merging free
blocks is less likely to occur.  Secondly, your blocks will be scattered about
less in the address space of the process, which means that on systems with
virtual memory there are less likely to be page faults if you need to access or
traverse all of the blocks you have created.

@cindex arenas
@cindex amalloc
A memory allocation concept that is similar to this is called an @emph{arena}.
This datatype requires functions which are built on top of the existing malloc
library functions and which associate each memory allocation with a particular
arena.  An arena can have as many allocations added to it as required, but
allocations cannot usually be freed until the whole arena is freed.  Note that
there are not really any generic implementations of arenas that are available as
everyone tends to write their own version when they require it, although SGI
IRIX and Compaq Tru64 systems do come with an arena library called
@emph{amalloc}.

@cindex slot tables
However, what if you don't plan to free all of the blocks at the same time?  A
slight modification to the above design could be to have a @emph{slot table}.
This would involve allocating chunks of blocks as they are required, adding each
individual block within a chunk to a singly-linked list of free blocks.  Then,
as new blocks are required, the allocator would simply choose the first block on
the free list, otherwise it would allocate memory for a new chunk of blocks and
add them to the free list.  Freeing individual blocks would simply involve
returning the block to the free list.  If this description isn't clear enough,
have a look in @file{src/slots.h} and @file{src/slots.c}.  This is how the
mpatrol library allocates memory from the system for all of its internal
structures.  For variable-sized structures, a slightly different approach needs
to be taken, but for an example of this using strings see @file{src/strtab.h}
and @file{src/strtab.c}.

Another optimisation that is possible on UNIX and Windows platforms is making
use of memory-mapped files.  This allows you to map a filesystem object into the
address space of your process, thus allowing you to treat a file as an array of
bytes.  Because it uses the virtual memory system to map the file, any changes
you make to the mapped memory will be applied to the file.  This is implemented
through the virtual memory system treating the file as a pseudo swap file and
will therefore only use up physical memory when pages are accessed.  It also
means that file operations can be replaced by memory read and write operations,
leading to a very fast and efficient way of performing I/O@.  Another added
bonus of this system means that entire blocks of process memory can be written
to a file for later re-use, just as long as the file can later be mapped to the
same address.  This can be a lot faster than writing to and reading from a
specific format of file.

If you really don't want to keep track of dynamic memory allocations at all then
perhaps you should consider @emph{garbage collection}.  This allows you to make
dynamic memory allocations that need not necessarily be matched by corresponding
calls to free these allocations.  A garbage collector will (at certain points
during program execution) attempt to look for memory allocations that are no
longer referenced by the program and free them for later re-use, hence removing
all possibility of memory leaks.  However, the garbage collection process can
take a sizable chunk of processor time depending on how large the program is, so
it is not really an option for real-time programming.  It is also very
platform-dependent as it examines very low-level structures within a process in
order to determine which pointers point to which memory allocations.  But there
is at least one garbage collector@footnote{A freely distributably library
called GC (@pxref{Related software}).} that works well with C and C++ and acts
as a replacement for @code{malloc()} and @code{free()}, so it may be the ideal
solution for you.

If you do choose to use an alternative malloc library make sure that you have a
license to do so and that you follow any distribution requirements.  On systems
that support dynamic linking you may want to link the library statically rather
than dynamically so that you don't have to worry about an additional file that
would need to be installed.  However, whether you have that choice depends on
the license for the specific library, and some licenses also require that the
source code for the library be made readily available.  Shared libraries have
the advantage that they can be updated with bug fixes so that all programs that
require these libraries will automatically receive these fixes without needing
to be relinked.

@cindex performance bottleneck
If all of the above suggestions do not seem to help and you still feel that you
have a performance bottleneck in the part of your code that deals with
dynamically allocated memory then you should try using the memory allocation
profiling feature of mpatrol.  This can be used at run-time to analyse the
dynamic memory allocation calls that your program makes during its execution,
and builds statistics for later viewing with the @command{mprof} command.  It is
then possible for you to see exactly how many calls were made to each function
and where they came from.  Such information can then be put to good use in order
to optimise the relevant parts of your code.  The tracing output files that can
be produced by the mpatrol library may also be useful in order to view patterns
in memory allocation behaviour and gather information about lifetimes of memory
allocations.

@cindex hints
@cindex tips
And finally, some tips on how to correctly use dynamic memory allocations.  The
first, most basic rule is to @emph{always} check the return values from
@code{malloc()} and related functions.  @emph{Never} assume that a call to
@code{malloc()} will succeed, because you're unlikely to be able to read the
future@footnote{If you can, why are you reading this --- you've already read
it!}.  Alternatively, use (or write) an @code{xmalloc()} or similar
function@footnote{The mpatrol library comes with the @code{xmalloc()} and
@code{MP_MALLOC()} families of functions.}, which calls @code{malloc()} but
never returns @samp{NULL} since it will abort instead.  With the C++ operators
it is slightly different because some versions use exceptions to indicate
failure, so you should always provide a handler to deal with this eventuality.

@cindex portability
@cindex ANSI
Never use @emph{features}@footnote{Whether they are documented or not.} of
specific malloc libraries if you want your code to be portable.  Always follow
the ANSI C or C++ calling conventions and never make assumptions about the
function or operator you are about to call --- the standards committees went to
great lengths to explicitly specify its behaviour.  For example, don't assume
that the contents of a freed memory allocation will remain valid until the next
call to @code{malloc()}, and don't assume that the contents of a newly
allocated memory block will be zeroed unless you created it with
@code{calloc()}.

Try to avoid allocating arrays on the stack if they are to hold data that may
overflow.  In most cases this is common sense, but sometimes you may allocate
an array that should suffice for 99% of the time.  However, if there is a 1%
chance that it may overflow then on some systems the stack is executable and
hackers can use that @emph{feature} to break into a secure program by
overwriting the current function's return address on the stack.  Use
statically-allocated or dynamically-allocated arrays for these situations, or
better still, check for overflow.

@cindex stress testing
Finally, try stress-testing your program in low memory conditions.  The mpatrol
library contains the @option{LIMIT} option which can place an upper bound on the
size of the heap, and also contains the @option{FAILFREQ} and @option{FAILSEED}
options which can cause random memory allocation failures.  Doing this will test
parts of your code that you would probably never expect to be called, but
perhaps they will one day!  Who would you rather have debugging your program ---
yourself or the user?

@node How it works, Examples, Improving performance, Top
@chapter How it works
@cindex implementation details

The mpatrol library was originally written with the intention of plugging it
into an existing compiler so that the compiler could plant calls to it in the
code it generated when a specific debugging option was used.  These extra calls
would obviously slow the code down, but along with the stack checking options
that would be provided, this would give the user an enhanced run-time debugging
environment.  Unfortunately, this integration never happened, but the way that
mpatrol works is still significantly different from other malloc tracing
libraries.

@cindex best fit
@cindex first fit
@cindex allocation algorithm
In order to quickly determine exactly which memory allocation a heap address
belonged to it was necessary to be able to search the heap in an efficient
manner.  The traditional way of searching along a linked list was unfeasible,
so an implementation based on @emph{red-black trees} was used, where every known
memory allocation in the heap was given an entry in the tree, with their start
addresses as the key.  Another major design decision was to also choose
red-black trees to implement the @emph{best fit} allocation algorithm.  Although
@emph{first fit} was considered, I decided that best fit would allow the library
to have more control over the heap, with every free memory block in the heap
given an entry in the free tree, with their sizes as the key.  There was a bit
of work involved in getting the splitting and merging of free blocks to work
efficiently, but it seems to work well now.

@cindex original implementation
My original implementation had all of the information about each memory block
stored just before the block itself.  I eventually dropped that behaviour in
favour of storing all of the library's internal information in a separate part
of the heap.  I did that for two reasons.  The first was because of the problems
that would occur due to memory allocations with different alignment
requirements.  The second reason was that the library's internal structures
could be write-protected on systems with virtual memory, to prevent user code
interfering with the operation of the library.

Because the library attempts to record as much information as possible about
every memory allocation there will inevitably be a much larger memory
requirement when running a program linked with the library.  This will typically
be two or three times larger in magnitude, but will be affected by the number
of memory allocations made and also the number of symbols read.  The latter
will also affect how quickly the program starts since the first call to allocate
memory will result in the initialisation of the library and the loading of
symbols from the executable file and any shared libraries.

@cindex hidden memory
Due to its design, it is also possible to allocate memory from the heap using
the mpatrol library functions whilst already within an mpatrol library function.
This does not normally occur, but on some platforms calling @code{printf()}
from within the library may result in @code{printf()} calling @code{malloc()} to
allocate itself a buffer, which ends up as a recursive call.  Luckily, this is
dealt with by simply not displaying the allocation in the log file, but all
other details of the allocation are still recorded.  This can sometimes result
in @emph{hidden} memory usage which occurs behind the scenes and alters the peak
memory usage in the summary.  This is particularly evident when the library uses
an object file access library to read program symbols at the time of library
initialisation.

Memory allocation profiling support was added for mpatrol release 1.2.0.  Every
allocation and deallocation is recorded, with the call stack information being
used to differentiate all of the call sites within the program.  Unlike other
profilers that come with UNIX systems, even the symbolic information about the
program being run is written to the profiling output file, since it makes no
sense for @command{mprof} to re-read the symbol table from the executable file
when it has already been read and processed by the mpatrol library.  It also has
the added bonus of allowing the user to save profiling output files for later
use even when the executable files which produced them have changed or no longer
exist.  It also means that symbol names can be obtained for functions in shared
libraries.

@cindex DWARF
Memory allocation tracing support was added for mpatrol release 1.3.2 and was
added to produce concise information for every memory allocation event.  This
information could also be produced in a verbose form in the log file, but to log
every memory allocation event in a large program would result in a massive log
file that would be hard to parse.  In order to keep the size of the tracing
output file down, almost all of the data in the file is encoded as LEB128
numbers.  The idea for this comes from the DWARF 2 debugging format.

Support for the @code{alloca()} family of functions was added for mpatrol
release 1.3.0 and uses the heap instead of the stack in order to trace and debug
these functions.  If full call stack tracebacks are supported on a particular
system then mpatrol will compare the current call stack with the call stack of
the function that called @code{alloca()} in order to determine if a memory
allocation made by @code{alloca()} is out of scope.  This is generally a safe
way to determine when such allocations should be freed, but if full call stack
tracebacks are not supported then mpatrol will compare the addresses of specific
local variables in the call stack in order to determine if the allocation should
be freed.  This is an inferior method since it depends on the same function call
sequence being used each time an mpatrol function is called.  Therefore, a
safety boundary was added that will prevent mpatrol from freeing such
allocations unless they are a really clear-cut case (i.e.@: the stack frames
differ by a minimum number of bytes).  As a result, this second method will not
usually free such allocations until a much later point.

@cindex modules
The library is written in a modular fashion so as to make it easy to add new
functionality.  New modules have already been added, such as the @emph{stack},
@emph{symbol}, @emph{profile} and @emph{trace} modules.  Extra information about
each memory allocation can be added to the @emph{allocation information} module
in @file{src/info.h} and @file{src/info.c} without having to change much code in
any other files.

The @file{tools} directory in the mpatrol distribution comes with a collection
of functions that are built on top of the mpatrol library using its interface
functions.  This provides a way to extend the mpatrol library for specific
applications without requiring that all applications use the extensions.  It
also provides a way to add new interfaces to the library, perhaps for
compatibility with other malloc debugging libraries.

Platform-dependent code has been isolated to specific modules, and feature
macros are entirely defined and controlled from @file{config.h} and
@file{target.h}.  The source code has been written so as to make it as easy as
possible to compile the library on new platforms at the first attempt, although
any additional features that the platform supports will then have to be
explicitly enabled in the code.

Of the UNIX platforms that the mpatrol library runs on, Solaris and Linux
proved to be the easiest to port to, with well documented and easily accessible
programming interfaces to operating system features.  Unfortunately, the
non-UNIX ports proved a lot harder to write and do not contain as many of the
useful features that the UNIX ports have, although sometimes not because they
cannot ever support them, but because there would be a huge amount of work
involved.

@node Examples, Tutorial, How it works, Top
@chapter Examples
@cindex examples

Following are a set of examples that are intended to illustrate what exactly is
possible with the mpatrol library and how to go about using it effectively.

You should already have built and installed the library and should know how to
link programs with the library.  Unfortunately, it isn't possible to give
specific instructions on how to do this as it varies from system to system and
also depends on your preferred compiler and development tools.

@cindex SVR4
However, on a typical SVR4 UNIX system, with mpatrol installed in
@file{/usr/local}, the mpatrol library can usually be incorporated into a
program using the following commands:

@itemize @bullet
@cindex a.out
@item
If the mpatrol library was built with no support for any object file format or
was built with support for the @file{a.out} object file format:

@smallexample
cc -I/usr/local/include <file> -L/usr/local/lib -lmpatrol
@end smallexample

@cindex COFF
@cindex XCOFF
@item
If the mpatrol library was built with support for the COFF or XCOFF object file
format access library (not on LynxOS systems):

@smallexample
cc -I/usr/local/include <file> -L/usr/local/lib -lmpatrol -lld
@end smallexample

@cindex ELF32
@cindex ELF64
@item
If the mpatrol library was built with support for the ELF32 or ELF64 object file
format access library:

@smallexample
cc -I/usr/local/include <file> -L/usr/local/lib -lmpatrol -lelf
@end smallexample

@cindex BFD
@item
If the mpatrol library was built with support for the GNU BFD object file format
access library:

@smallexample
cc -I/usr/local/include <file> -L/usr/local/lib -lmpatrol -lbfd
   -liberty -lintl
@end smallexample

@item
If the mpatrol library was built with support for the GNU BFD object file format
access library and the libunwind stack traversal library:

@smallexample
cc -I/usr/local/include <file> -L/usr/local/lib -lmpatrol -lbfd
   -liberty -lintl -lunwind
@end smallexample

@item
If the mpatrol library was built on HP/UX with support for the GNU BFD object
file format access library:

@smallexample
cc -I/usr/local/include <file> -L/usr/local/lib -lmpatrol -lbfd
   -liberty -lintl -lcl
@end smallexample
@end itemize

On Windows platforms, with mpatrol installed in @file{/mpatrol}, the mpatrol
library can usually be incorporated into a program using the following commands:

@itemize @bullet
@cindex PE
@item
If the program is to be linked with the archive version of the mpatrol library:

@smallexample
cl -I/mpatrol/include -Zi <file> -link -libpath:/mpatrol/lib
   -defaultlib:libmpatrol -defaultlib:imagehlp -pdb:none
@end smallexample

@item
If the program is to be linked with the DLL version of the mpatrol library:

@smallexample
cl -I/mpatrol/include -MD -Zi <file> -link -libpath:/mpatrol/lib
   -defaultlib:mpatrol -pdb:none
@end smallexample
@end itemize

If you need to link with other libraries, make sure that they don't contain
definitions of @code{malloc()}, etc.@:, or if they do then you must ensure that
the mpatrol library appears before them on the link line.  Note also that if the
mpatrol library was built on Tru64, or on IRIX with the
@code{MP_LIBRARYSTACK_SUPPORT} preprocessor macro defined, then the
@file{libexc} library must be linked in as well.  You should also check the
section on supported systems (@pxref{Supported systems}) to see if there are any
other issues on the platform that you are using.

You should also know how to set an environment variable on your specific system.
Again, this varies from system to system and also depends on the command line
interpreter or shell that you use.  The environment variable that the mpatrol
library uses is called @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}.  You can see exactly what options
are available for this environment variable by setting it to @option{HELP} and
then running a program that has been linked with the library.

@section Getting started

@cindex crash
The first example we'll look at is when the argument in a call to @code{free()}
doesn't match the return value from @code{malloc()}, even though the intention
is to free the memory that was allocated by @code{malloc()}.  This example is in
@file{tests/fail/test1.c} and causes many existing @code{malloc()}
implementations to crash.

Along the way, I'll try to describe as many features of the mpatrol library as
possible, and illustrate them with examples.  Note that the output from your
version of the library is likely to vary slightly from that shown in the
examples, especially on non-UNIX systems.

@enumerate 1
@cindex allocation type
@cindex type of allocation
@item
Allocation type.  This generalises the type of dynamic memory operation that is
being performed, and can be one of @samp{ALLOC}, @samp{REALLOC} or @samp{FREE}.
This should make looking for all allocations, reallocations or frees in the log
file a lot easier.  Alternatively, if a memory operation function was called
then this can also be one of @samp{MEMSET}, @samp{MEMCOPY}, @samp{MEMFIND} or
@samp{MEMCMP}.

@item
Allocation function.  This is the name of the function that has been called to
allocate the memory, in this case @samp{malloc}.

@cindex allocation index
@item
Allocation index.  This is incremented every time a new memory allocation is
requested, and persists even if the memory allocation is resized with
@code{realloc()} and its related functions, so can be useful to keep track of a
memory allocation, even if its start address changes.  The mpatrol library may
use up the first few allocation indices when it gets initialised.

@item
Size of requested allocation.

@item
Alignment for requested allocation.  This is normally the default system
alignment for general-purpose memory allocations, but may be different depending
on the type of function that is used to allocate the memory.
@end enumerate

The following information contains source file details of where the call to
@code{malloc()} came from, but is only available if the source file containing
the call to @code{malloc()} included @file{mpatrol.h}; otherwise the fields will
all be @samp{-}@footnote{This information may also be filled in if the
@option{USEDEBUG} option or the @command{mpsym} command is used and supported,
and if debugging information about the call to @code{malloc()} is available.}.
Because of the convoluted way this information is obtained for the C++
operators, you may encounter some problems in existing C++ programs when making
direct calls to @code{operator new} for example.  However, if you want to
disable the redefinition of the C++ operators in @file{mpatrol.h} you can define
the preprocessor macro @code{MP_NOCPLUSPLUS} before the inclusion of that file.
Alternatively, you may wish to define the @code{MP_NONEWDELETE} preprocessor
macro in order to use @code{MP_NEW}, @code{MP_NEW_NOTHROW} and @code{MP_DELETE}
instead of @code{new} and @code{delete}.  That way you can combine calls to
mpatrol's operators and the standard operators.  Just make sure you don't mix
them!

If you are running on a system on which mpatrol supports full symbolic stack
tracebacks the following information may still be useful if the source files
were compiled with optimisation turned on.  This is because the calling function
may have been inlined, in which case you will only see the name of the function
into which the calling function was expanded in the stack traceback.

@enumerate 6
@cindex gcc
@cindex g++
@item
Function where call to @code{malloc()} took place.  This information is only
available if the source file containing the call to @code{malloc()} was compiled
with @command{gcc} or @command{g++}.

@item
Filename in which call to @code{malloc()} took place.

@item
Line number at which call to @code{malloc()} took place.
@end enumerate

@cindex entry-point
The following information contains function call stack details of where the
call to @code{malloc()} came from, but is only available if the mpatrol library
has been built on a platform that supports this.  The top-most entry should be
the function which called @code{malloc()} and the bottom-most entry should be
the entry-point for the process.

@enumerate 9
@item
Address of function call.  This is normally the address of the machine
instruction immediately after the function call instruction, also known as the
return address.

@cindex C++ mangled names
@cindex mangled names
@cindex demangler
@item
Function where call took place.  This information is only available if the
mpatrol library has been built on a platform that supports reading symbol table
information from executable files, and then only if there is an entry in the
symbol table corresponding to the return address.  C++ function names may still
be in their mangled form, but this can be easily rectified by processing the
log file with a C++ name demangler.  The number after the plus sign is the
offset in bytes from the beginning of the function.
@end enumerate

The following information is only available when the allocation type is
@samp{ALLOC} or @samp{REALLOC} since it makes no sense when applied to
@samp{FREE}.

@enumerate 11
@item
The address of the new memory block that has been allocated by @code{malloc()}.
@end enumerate

As you can see, there is quite a lot of information that can be displayed from
a simple call to @code{malloc()}, and hopefully this information has been
presented in a clear and concise format in the log file.

The next entries in the log file correspond to the call to @code{free()}, which
attempts to free the memory allocated by @code{malloc()}, but supplies the wrong
address.

The first four lines should be self-explanatory as they are very similar to
those described above for @code{malloc()}.  However, the next lines signal that
a terminal error has occurred in the program, so I've annotated them as before.

@enumerate 1
@cindex error severity
@cindex severity of errors
@cindex recoverable errors
@cindex fatal errors
@item
Error severity.  The mpatrol library has two different severities of error:
@samp{WARNING} and @samp{ERROR}.  The first is always recoverable, and serves
only to indicate that something is not quite right, and so may be useful in
determining where something started to go wrong.  The second may or may not be
recoverable, and the library terminates the program if it is fatal, displaying
any relevant information as it does this.

@cindex error abbreviation code
@item
Error abbreviation code.  This is a code that is different for each type of
error that is detected by the mpatrol library.  Some warnings and errors that
are not directly related to the program being run will not contain this field.
See the appendix on diagnostic messages (@pxref{Diagnostic messages}) for a
complete list of all possible error abbreviation codes and their descriptions.

@item
Allocation function.  This is the name of the function used to allocate,
reallocate or free memory where the error was detected.  This may be omitted if
an error is detected elsewhere in the library.
@end enumerate

The following information is related to the information that the library has
stored about the relevant memory allocation.  This information is always
displayed in this format when details of individual memory allocations are
required.  If any information is missing then it simply means that the library
was not able to determine it when the memory block was first allocated.

@enumerate 4
@item
Address of memory allocation.

@item
Size of memory allocation.

@item
Allocation function.  This is the name of the function that was called to
allocate the memory block, in this case @samp{malloc}.  If the memory allocation
has been resized then this will be either @samp{realloc}, @samp{reallocf},
@samp{recalloc}, @samp{expand} or @samp{xrealloc}.

@item
Allocation index.

@item
Reallocation index.  This is used to count the number of times a memory
allocation has been resized with @code{realloc()} and its related functions.

@item
Function where original call to @code{malloc()} took place.  If the memory
allocation has been resized then this will be the name of the function which
last called @code{realloc()} and its related functions.

@item
Filename in which original call to @code{malloc()} took place.  If the memory
allocation has been resized then this will be the filename in which the last
call to @code{realloc()} and its related functions took place.

@item
Line number at which original call to @code{malloc()} took place.  If the memory
allocation has been resized then this will be the line number at which the last
call to @code{realloc()} and its related functions took place.

@item
Function call stack of original memory allocation.  If the memory allocation has
been resized then this will be the call stack of the last call to
@code{realloc()} and related functions.
@end enumerate

So, the mpatrol library detected the error in the above program and terminated
it.  When the library terminates it always displays a summary of various memory
allocation statistics and settings that were used during the execution of the
program.

The various settings and statistics displayed by the library for the above
example have been numbered and their descriptions appear below.

@end smallexample

@enumerate 1
@item
System page size.  This value is used on some platforms when allocating and
protecting system memory.

@item
Default alignment.  This value is the minimum alignment required for general
purpose memory allocations, and is usually the alignment required by the most
restrictive datatype on a given system.  It is used when allocating memory that
has no specified alignment.  It can be changed at run-time using the
@option{DEFALIGN} option, but setting this value too small may cause the program
to crash due to bus errors which are caused by reading from or writing to
misaligned data.

@item
Overflow size.  This value is the size used by one overflow buffer.  If this is
non-zero then every memory allocation will have two overflow buffers; one on
either side.  These buffers are used by the library to detect if the program
has written too many bytes to a memory allocation, thus overflowing into one of
the buffers, but these extra checks can slow down execution speed.  It can be
changed at run-time using the @option{OFLOWSIZE} option.

@item
Overflow byte.
@item
Allocation byte.
@item
Free byte.  These values are used by the library to pre-fill blocks of memory
for checking purposes.  The overflow byte is used to fill overflow buffers, the
allocation byte is used to fill newly-allocated memory (except from
@code{calloc()} or @code{recalloc()}), and the free byte is used to fill free
blocks or freed memory allocations.  These can be changed at run-time using the
@option{OFLOWBYTE}, @option{ALLOCBYTE} and @option{FREEBYTE} options.

@item
Allocation stop.
@item
Reallocation stop.
@item
Free stop.  These values are used by the library to halt the program when run
inside a debugger whenever a specified allocation index is allocated,
reallocated or freed.  These can be changed at run-time using the
@option{ALLOCSTOP}, @option{REALLOCSTOP} and @option{FREESTOP} options.

@cindex unfreed allocations
@item
Unfreed abort.  This value is used when the program terminates and is used by
the library to check if there are more than a given number of unfreed memory
allocations.  If there are then the library will cause the program to abort
with an error.  It can be changed at run-time using the @option{UNFREEDABORT}
option.

@item
Small boundary.
@item
Medium boundary.
@item
Large boundary.  These values are used in memory allocation profiling and
specify the boundaries in bytes between small, medium, large and extra large
allocations.  These can be changed at run-time using the @option{SMALLBOUND},
@option{MEDIUMBOUND} and @option{LARGEBOUND} options.

@item
Lower check range.
@item
Upper check range.
@item
Check frequency.  These values specify the range of allocation indices through
which the library will physically check every area of free memory and every
overflow buffer for errors, along with the frequency at which to make the
checks.  A dash specifies that either the lower or upper range is infinite, but
if they are both zero then no such checking will ever be performed, thus
speeding up execution speed dramatically.  The check frequency indicates the
number of memory allocation events that must occur in between checking the heap.
The library defaults to performing no such checks.  This can be changed at
run-time using the @option{CHECK} option.

@item
Failure frequency.
@item
Failure seed.  These values are used to specify if random memory allocation
failures should occur during program execution, for the purposes of stress
testing a program.  If the failure frequency is zero then no random failures
will occur, but if it is greater than zero then the higher the number, the less
frequent the failures.  The failure seed is used internally by the mpatrol
library when generating random numbers.  If it is zero then the seed will be set
randomly, but if it is greater than zero then it will be used to generate a
predictable sequence of random numbers; i.e.@: two runs of the same program with
the same failure frequencies and the same failure seeds will generate exactly
the same sequence of failures.

@cindex callback functions
@cindex functions, callback
@cindex handler functions
@cindex functions, handler
@cindex prologue function
@item
Prologue function.
@cindex epilogue function
@item
Epilogue function.
@cindex low memory handler function
@item
Handler function.  These values contain addresses or names of functions that
have been installed as callback functions for the library.  These functions, if
set, will be called from the library at appropriate times during program
execution in order to handle specific events.  These can be changed at
compile-time using the @code{__mp_prologue()}, @code{__mp_epilogue()} and
@code{__mp_nomemory()} functions.

@item
Log file.  Simply contains the name of the file where all mpatrol library
diagnostics go to.  It can be changed at run-time using the @option{LOGFILE}
option.

@item
Profiling file.  Contains the name of the file where all of the mpatrol
library memory allocation profiling information goes when the @option{PROF}
option is used.  It can be changed at run-time using the @option{PROFFILE}
option.

@item
Tracing file.  Contains the name of the file where all of the mpatrol library
memory allocation tracing information goes when the @option{TRACE} option is
used.  It can be changed at run-time using the @option{TRACEFILE} option.

@item
Program filename.  Contains the full pathname to the program's executable file.
This is used by the mpatrol library to read the symbol table in order to
provide symbolic information in function call stacks.  It can be changed at
run-time using the @option{PROGFILE} option.

@item
Symbols read.  This value contains the total number of symbols read from a
program's executable file and/or the dynamic linker, if applicable.

@item
Autosave count.  This value contains the frequency at which the mpatrol library
should periodically write the profiling data to the profiling output file.  When
the total number of profiled memory allocations and deallocations is a multiple
of this number then the current profiling information will be written to the
profiling output file.  It can be changed at run-time using the
@option{AUTOSAVE} option.

@cindex freed queue
@item
Freed queue size.  This value contains the maximum number of freed memory
allocations that will be stored in the freed queue if the @option{NOFREE} option
is used.  Once the freed queue becomes full then the oldest freed allocation in
the queue will be returned to the free memory pool for reuse every time an
existing memory allocation is freed.  If this value is zero then the freed queue
will never contain any freed allocations.  It can be changed at run-time using
the @option{NOFREE} option.

@item
Allocation count.  This value contains the total number of memory allocations
that were created by the mpatrol library.  This value may be more than expected
if the mpatrol library makes any memory allocations during initialisation.

@cindex peak memory usage
@cindex memory usage
@item
Allocation peak.  This value contains the peak memory usage set by the program
when running; the peak number of memory allocations, and also the peak number of
bytes allocated in parentheses (the two numbers may peak at different times
throughout the lifetime of the program).  This value may be more than expected
if the mpatrol library makes any memory allocations during initialisation.

@item
Allocation limit.  This value is used to limit the amount of memory that can be
allocated by a program, which can be useful for stress-testing in simulated low
memory conditions.  It can be changed at run-time using the @option{LIMIT}
option.

@cindex memory blocks
@cindex blocks
@item
@cindex allocated blocks
Allocated blocks.
@item
@cindex marked blocks
Marked blocks.
@item
@cindex freed blocks
Freed blocks.
@item
@cindex free blocks
Free blocks.  These values contain the total number of allocated, marked, freed
and free blocks at the time the summary was produced.  A marked block is an
allocated block that the user has instructed (via the @code{__mp_setmark()}
function) the mpatrol library should remain allocated for the rest of the
lifetime of the program and should never be freed or counted as a memory leak.
A freed block is an allocated block that has been freed but has not been
returned to the free memory list for later allocation.  These values may be
different from those expected if the mpatrol library makes any memory
allocations during initialisation.  In this example a large amount of memory is
used by the system object file access library which is used for reading the
symbols from the program's executable file and any shared libraries that it
requires.

@cindex internal blocks
@item
Internal blocks.  This value contains the total number of memory blocks (of
varying sizes) that have been allocated from the system for the mpatrol library
to use internally.  These memory blocks will be write-protected on systems that
support memory protection in order to prevent the program from corrupting the
library's data structures.  This can be overridden at run-time using the
@option{NOPROTECT} option in order to speed up program execution slightly.

@cindex heap usage
@item
Total heap usage.  This value contains the total amount of system heap memory
that has been allocated by the mpatrol library.

@item
@cindex bytes compared
Total compared.
@item
@cindex bytes located
Total located.
@item
@cindex bytes copied
Total copied.
@item
@cindex bytes set
Total set.  These values contain the total number of bytes that have been
tracked by the mpatrol library in byte comparison operations (such as
@code{memcmp()}), byte location operations (such as @code{memchr()}, byte copy
operations (such as @code{memcpy()}) and byte set operations (such as
@code{memset()}) respectively.  They do not take into account any other such
operations that occur outwith these functions, such as loading and storing from
machine instructions.

@item
Total warnings.
@item
Total errors.  The library keeps a count of the total number of warnings and
errors it has displayed so that you can quickly work out this information at
program termination.

@cindex tree structure
The mpatrol library stores all of its information about allocated and free
memory in tree structures so that it can quickly determine if an address belongs
to allocated or free memory, or if it even exists in the heap that is managed by
mpatrol.  The above example should illustrate this since after the allocation
had been freed, the library recognised this and reported an error.  It was
possible for the program to continue execution even after that error since
mpatrol could recover from it and return @samp{NULL}.

It is possible for mpatrol to give even more useful diagnostics in the above
situation by using the @option{NOFREE} option.  This prevents the library from
returning any freed allocations to the free memory pool, by preserving any
information about them and marking them as freed.  If you add the
@option{NOFREE=1} option to the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable you
should see the following entries in @file{mpatrol.log} instead.

@end smallexample

Note the extra information reported by @code{realloc()} since the library knows
all of the details about the freed memory allocation and when it was freed.

The @option{NOFREE} option can potentially use up much more system memory than
normal if it is given a large numerical argument since it effectively instructs
the mpatrol library to allocate new memory for every single memory allocation or
reallocation.  It can also slow down program execution when overflow buffers are
used, since with each new memory allocation the library needs to check more and
more overflow buffers every time it is called.  However, with a low numerical
argument it can be quite useful for problems such as this one.  The test in
@file{tests/fail/test3.c} has a similar situation.

The numerical argument specified with the @option{NOFREE} option indicates the
number of recently-freed memory allocations that are to be delayed from being
returned to the free memory pool, with a value of zero meaning that all freed
memory allocations will immediately be reused.  Obviously, in an ideal world it
would be nice to be able to specify @option{NOFREE=}@emph{huge-number} all the
time, but this will gradually use up more and more memory since no system heap
memory will ever be reused.  Supplying a smaller number to the @option{NOFREE}
option allows you to make a compromise by storing the details of only the most
recently-freed memory allocations.  How many details you wish to store is up to
you.

Normally, the @option{NOFREE} option will cause the library to fill all freed
memory allocations with the free byte.  However, the original contents of such
allocations can be preserved with the @option{PRESERVE} option.  This could
help in situations when you need to determine exactly if a program is relying on
the contents of freed memory.

@node Example 3, Example 4, Example 2, Examples
@section Detecting use of free memory

This next example illustrates how the mpatrol library is able to check to see
if anything has been written into free memory.  The test is located in
@file{tests/fail/test4.c} and simply writes a single byte into free memory.

@smallexample
23  /*
24   * Allocates a block of 16 bytes and then immediately frees it.  A

@end smallexample

The library was able to detect that something had been written into free memory
and could report on the memory allocation that was overwritten.  However, these
checks are only performed whenever a function in the mpatrol library is called
if the @option{CHECK} option is used, or at the end of program execution.  In
the example above, the code which wrote into free memory could have been miles
away from where the library detected the error since we were not using the
@option{CHECK} option.  However, adding @option{CHECK=-} to the
@env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable doesn't really help much since the
next mpatrol function that is called is the one to terminate the library anyway.

Note that using the @option{CHECK} option is equivalent to calling
@code{__mp_check()} when each mpatrol library function is called, or at the
range and frequency specified in the values passed to the @option{CHECK} option.
If you suspect that heap corruption is occurring in a part of your code where
there is a large gap between mpatrol library calls, you can try to narrow the
problem down by adding a few calls to @code{__mp_check()}.

On platforms that support memory protection, the library also supports the
@option{PAGEALLOC} option.  This option instructs the library to force every
single memory allocation to have a size which is a multiple of the system page
size.  Although the library still stores the original requested size, it
effectively means that no two memory allocations occupy the same page of memory.
It can then use page protection (which only operates on pages of memory) to
protect all free memory from being read from or written to, and uses similar
features to install a page of overflow buffer on either side of the allocation.

@cindex fitting allocations
However, if the requested size for the memory allocation was not a multiple of
the page size this means that there will still be unused space left over in the
allocated pages.  This problem is solved by turning the unused space into
overflow buffers that will be checked in the normal way.  The positioning of the
allocation within its pages is also important.  If you want to check for illegal
reads from the borders of the memory allocation, unless it fits exactly into its
pages then there is a chance that a program could illegally read the right-most
overflow buffer if the allocation was left-aligned, or vice-versa.  Two settings
therefore exist for the @option{PAGEALLOC} option: @option{LOWER} and
@option{UPPER}.  They refer to the placement of every memory allocation within
its constituent pages.

The following diagram illustrates the @option{PAGEALLOC} option.  In the
diagram, the system page size is assumed to be 16 bytes (very unlikely, but will
serve for this example) and each character represents 1 byte.

@smallexample
x = allocated memory
o = overflow buffer (filled with the overflow byte)
. = overflow buffer page (read and write protected)

PAGEALLOC=LOWER, allocation size is 16 bytes or
PAGEALLOC=UPPER, allocation size is 16 bytes:
    ................xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx................

PAGEALLOC=LOWER, allocation size is 8 bytes:
    ................xxxxxxxxoooooooo................

PAGEALLOC=UPPER, allocation size is 8 bytes:
    ................ooooooooxxxxxxxx................
@end smallexample

In our original example, if the @option{PAGEALLOC=LOWER} option is added to the
@env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable then the following error will be
produced instead of the original error.

@smallexample

@end smallexample

@cindex signal handler
@cindex illegal memory accesses
On systems that support memory protection, the mpatrol library has a built-in
signal handler which catches illegal memory accesses and terminates the program.
In the above case, the freed memory was made write-protected and so could not be
written to.  The underlying virtual memory system in the operating system
noticed this and signaled this to the library immediately after it happened.

Along with the details of the freed memory allocation that was being written to,
the library also attempts to display the function call stack for the location in
the program that caused the illegal memory access, although this can be quite
unreliable.  A better solution would be to run the program in a debugger to
catch the illegal memory access.

Note that the @option{PAGEALLOC} option also modifies the behaviour of the
@option{NOFREE} and @option{PRESERVE} options when used together.  The memory
allocation being freed will always be made write-protected when the
@option{PRESERVE} option is used, otherwise it will also be made read-protected
to prevent further accesses.

Note also that the @option{PAGEALLOC=UPPER} option is potentially much less
efficient at catching illegal memory accesses than the @option{PAGEALLOC=LOWER}
option.  This is due to alignment requirements, since an allocation of 1 byte
requiring an alignment of 16 bytes cannot be placed at the very end of a page of
size 4096 bytes.  The following diagram illustrates this, using the same page
size as the last diagram.

@smallexample
x = allocated memory
o = overflow buffer (filled with the overflow byte)
. = overflow buffer page (read and write protected)

PAGEALLOC=UPPER, allocation size is 16 bytes, alignment is 8 bytes:
    ................xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx................

PAGEALLOC=UPPER, allocation size is 3 bytes, alignment is 1 byte:
    ................oooooooooooooxxx................

PAGEALLOC=UPPER, allocation size is 3 bytes, alignment is 8 bytes:
    ................ooooooooxxxooooo................
@end smallexample

Everything is OK until the last allocation, where the alignment requirement
means that there must be two overflow buffers.  This slows down program
execution since the library must check an additional overflow buffer, and also
means that the program would have to read six bytes beyond the end of the
allocation before the illegal memory access would be detected.

@section Using overflow buffers

This example illustrates the use of overflow buffers and so the
@env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable should have @option{OFLOWSIZE=2}

options for the purposes of this example.  The test is located in

@cindex memory dump
@cindex dumping memory
Once again, the library attempts to show you as much detail as possible about
where the corruption occurred.  Along with showing you a memory dump of the
overflow buffer that was corrupted, it also shows you the allocation to which
the overflow buffer belongs.

Using overflow buffers and the @option{CHECK=-} option can reduce the speed of
program execution since the library has to check every buffer whenever it is
called, and if the buffers are larger then they'll take longer to check and will
use up more memory.  However, larger buffers mean that there is less chance of
the program writing past one memory allocation into another.

Alternatively, the @option{CHECK} option can be used to limit the number of
checks that the library has to perform, thus speeding up program execution.
This option specifies a range of allocation indices through which the library
will check overflow buffers and free memory for corruption.  Such checks occur
when they normally would, but only if the current allocation index falls within
the specified range.  This feature can be used when there is a suspicion that
free memory corruption or overflow buffer corruption occurs at a certain point
during program execution, but checking them at every library call would take too
long.  You can also specify a frequency at which to check the heap using the
@option{CHECK} option.  This can be used when attempting to narrow down the
search for where heap corruption occurs.

On systems which support software watch points, there is an extra option called
@option{OFLOWWATCH} which allows additional memory protection.  Watch points
allow individual bytes to be read and/or write protected as opposed to just
pages.  The @option{OFLOWWATCH} option installs software watch points at every
overflow buffer instead of requiring the library to check the integrity of the
overflow buffers, and can be used in combination with @option{PAGEALLOC}.
However, software watch points slow down program execution to a crawl since
every machine instruction must be checked individually by the system to see if
it accesses a watch point area.  Slowing the program down by a factor of 10,000
is not uncommon on some systems when the @option{OFLOWWATCH} option is used.

@node Example 5, Example 6, Example 4, Examples
@section Checking memory accesses

For the ultimate in heap checking, if you are using the GNU compiler you can use
the @option{-fcheck-memory-usage} option.  This instructs the compiler to place
error-checking calls before each read or write to memory.  The functions that
are called then check to ensure that the memory access does not overflow a heap
memory allocation or access free memory.

The following test (which can be found in @file{tests/fail/test17.c}) has an
example of a read from memory which overflows a memory allocation's boundaries.

@smallexample
23  /*
24   * Allocates a single byte of memory and then attempts to read the

26   * This can sometimes be detected with PAGEALLOC=UPPER but can always
27   * be detected with OFLOWWATCH or by using the -fcheck-memory-usage
28   * option of gcc.
29   */


32  #include "mpatrol.h"


35  int main(void)
36  @{
37      int *p;
38      int r;

40      if (p = (int *) calloc(1, 1))
41      @{
42          r = p[0];
43          free(p);
44      @}
45      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
46  @}
@end smallexample

For this example, the above test must be compiled with @command{gcc} with the
@option{-fcheck-memory-usage} option on the compiler command line and linked
with the mpatrol library.  Normally, the test will pass and not cause any
problems, since most malloc libraries will allocate at least one word anyway.
However, there are some instances where that will not be the case, especially
on systems where misaligned memory accesses are legal.  Also, if the
implementation of @code{calloc()} only initialised the number of bytes requested
then the number read back might not be zero.

If you now run the program it should abort and produce something similar to the
following in the resulting @file{mpatrol.log}.

@smallexample

@section Bad memory operations

In C there are several basic memory operation functions that are often called
to perform tasks such as clearing memory, copying memory, etc.  The mpatrol
library contains replacements for these which allow for better checking of their
arguments to prevent reading and writing past the boundaries of existing memory
allocations.  The following source can be found in @file{tests/fail/test9.c}.

@end smallexample

When this is compiled and run, the following should appear in the log file.

@smallexample

        0x08049381 _start+33
@end smallexample

As you can see, the library detected that the @code{memset()} function would
have written past the boundaries of the memory allocation and reported this to
you.  It then proceeded to ignore the request to copy the memory and continued
with the execution of the program@footnote{The error can be turned into a
warning with the @option{ALLOWOFLOW} option which will also force the operation
to be performed.}.  Note that this will only be done for known memory
allocations.  Reading and writing past the boundaries of static and stack memory
allocations cannot be detected in this way.

If the @option{LOGMEMORY} option is added to the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}
environment variable then it is possible to see a log of all the mpatrol library
memory operation functions that were called during program execution.  For
example, adding this option and running the above program again will produce
something similar to the following.

@smallexample
MEMSET: memset (0x08062FB7, 18 bytes, 0x00) [main|test9.c|39]
        0x0804945B main+75
        0x4007C9CB __libc_start_main+255
        0x08049381 _start+33
@end smallexample

This is similar to the tracing produced for memory allocation functions, except
that the arguments in parentheses mean different things.  For @samp{MEMSET},
the first argument represents the start of the memory block to set, the second
argument represents the number of bytes to set and the third argument represents
the actual byte to set.

For @samp{MEMCOPY}, the first argument represents the source memory block, the
second argument represents the destination memory block, the third argument
represents the number of bytes to copy and the fourth argument represents a byte
to copy up to if @code{memccpy()} is being called.  This is similar for
@samp{MEMCMP}.

For @samp{MEMFIND}, the first and second arguments represent the source memory
block and its length, while the third and fourth arguments represent the memory
block to search for and its length.  In the implementation for @code{memchr()},
the byte to search for is copied to a one byte buffer and the address of that
buffer is used as the memory block to search for.

Note that as with the memory allocation functions, @samp{MEMCMP},
@samp{MEMFIND}, @samp{MEMCOPY} and @samp{MEMSET} are used to generalise the
types of operations being performed and are followed by the names of the actual
functions being used.  In some cases the functions may use a different ordering
of parameters than that shown.

@section Incompatible function calls

This example illustrates how the mpatrol library checks for calls to
incompatible pairs of memory allocation functions.  It requires the use of
C++, although does not use any C++ features except for overloaded operators.

This shows a call to @code{operator new[]}, closely followed by a call to
@code{operator delete}.  However, in C++ calls to @code{operator new[]} must be
matched by calls to @code{operator delete[]} and not @code{operator delete}.
Hence, the library reports this as an error and does not free the memory
allocation.

@end smallexample

After the first call to @code{strdupa()}, there is a call to @code{alloca()}
followed by a call to @code{strdup()}.  Because the memory allocation made by
@code{strdupa()} is at the top level of the program it cannot automatically be
freed until @code{main()} returns.  However, at the next call to @code{alloca()}
in @code{f()}, the mpatrol library notices that the memory allocation that was
made by @code{alloca()} in @code{f1()} can be freed since @code{f1()} has
returned.  The relevant allocation is then freed before making the next memory
allocation.  You can see how it makes its decision by examining the call stack
at the point of deallocation.

However, all of the memory allocations made by @code{alloca()} in @code{f()}
cannot be freed until @code{f()} returns.  This can be seen in the two sets of
eight consecutive deallocations in the log file, each set followed by a call to
@code{dealloca()}.  The @code{dealloca()} function explicitly frees a memory
allocation that was made by the @code{alloca()} family of functions, but these
calls are not really necessary as all of these memory allocations would be freed
anyway when @code{main()} returns.  The call to @code{dealloca()} is really only
necessary to force a deallocation for a specific purpose at a certain point in
the program.  Note that implicit deallocations are marked as being done by
@code{alloca()} while explicit deallocations are marked as being done by
@code{dealloca()}.

The second test illustrates how the mpatrol library can help debug
@code{alloca()}-related problems by treating such memory allocations as normal
heap allocations.

As you can see, memory allocations made by @code{alloca()} are treated in
almost exactly the same way as normal memory allocations, with the result that
errors similar to those above can be detected by the mpatrol library.  The only
real difference between the two types of memory allocations is that allocations
made by the @code{alloca()} family of functions will never show up in the list
of unfreed memory allocations.

@node Example 9, Example 10, Example 8, Examples
@section The @code{MP_MALLOC()} functions

The mpatrol library comes with a set of alternative dynamic memory allocation
functions for C.  These allow it to record the type and type size of every
memory allocation made through these functions, which can be very useful for
debugging purposes.  It also means that the alignment for each memory allocation
can be determined according to its type.  The following test can be found in
@file{tests/pass/test9.c}.

As you can see, the type and number of items allocated of that type are
associated with each memory allocation.  The function names that are logged
as having made the memory allocations are from the @code{xmalloc()} family of
functions since that is how the @code{MP_MALLOC()} family of functions are
implemented.

The information that we are interested in comes after the summary of library
statistics generated in the log file.  The first block of data shows a memory
map of the heap that is being handled by mpatrol.  This can be used to see
graphically where a particular allocation is located, or to look for memory
fragmentation.  The @option{SHOWMAP} option also displays this information.

Note that gaps in the memory map can either be due to space used by internal
memory blocks or to some other memory allocation library using up space.  On
some systems that don't have virtual memory, gaps are likely to be owned by
other processes or belong to the system free memory list.  The @samp{@dots{}}

The next table is really only useful for seeing how much memory fragmentation
has occurred in the memory map.  It shows a breakdown of the free memory blocks
that have either resulted from the mpatrol library allocating uninitialised
memory from the system heap or from freeing existing memory allocations.  The
column on the left shows the size of the free block in bytes and the column on
the right shows the number of blocks of that size that are available.  The
@option{SHOWFREE} option also displays this information.

@smallexample
free blocks: 10 (2919 bytes)
       2280: 1
        508: 1

          4: 3
          3: 1
          1: 1
@end smallexample

The next block of data shows a summary of all freed memory allocations.  This is
only possible because the @option{NOFREE} option was also given, otherwise there
would be no details on freed memory allocations.  All of these entries show
where the allocation was freed, which can be useful if you quickly needed to see
where an allocation was freed.  The @option{SHOWFREED} option also displays this
information.  Note that the list will be limited to the size of the freed queue
and will show only the most recently-freed items.

As this example was run on UNIX, the mpatrol library replaces the default
implementations of @code{malloc()}, @code{free()}, etc.  As can be seen below,
this allows the library to trace all calls to allocate dynamic memory in a
process, even from functions that were not compiled with mpatrol.  Four of the
five functions shown below were called by the mpatrol library in order to read
the symbols from ELF object files.  However, they are located in the ELF access
library which was not compiled with mpatrol.

Note that the following data has again been cut down in size for the purposes of
this example.  The @samp{@dots{}} marks text that has been removed.

The final block of data shows a summary of all unfreed memory allocations.  This
can show up memory leaks, although all but one of the unfreed memory allocations
in this example come from the standard C library.  On systems such as UNIX it
does not really matter about these unfreed allocations since they will
automatically be returned to the system on process termination.

However, the other unfreed allocation shows an example of a memory leak, where
no pointers referencing that allocation remain in the program to free it with.
If this was within a loop then the program could quickly run away with memory,
causing at least a decrease in performance, and at most a memory shortage.  The
mpatrol library makes it easier to spot memory leaks, especially if the
@option{PROF} profiling option is used.

The @option{SHOWUNFREED} option also displays this information.

Beginning with mpatrol release 1.4.2, the @option{LEAKTABLE} option is
available to summarise the above unfreed memory allocations without including
the internal memory allocations that were made when the mpatrol library was
initialised.  If you add the @option{LEAKTABLE} option to the
@env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable and then re-run the program you
should see the following in the mpatrol log file:

@chapter Tutorial
@cindex tutorial

In this chapter we'll look at a real example of using the mpatrol library to
debug a program.  All of the following building and debugging steps were
performed on an Intel Linux machine so the details may differ slightly on
your system, but the concepts should remain the same.  However, on systems
without virtual memory some of the steps may actually cause the machine to lock
up or crash so be aware of this if you are running such a system --- you may be
safer just reading this tutorial rather than attempting it!

This tutorial will also make use of the option @option{USEDEBUG} which displays
source-level file names and line numbers associated with symbols in call stack
tracebacks, but only if the underlying object file access library supports
reading line tables from object files and even then only if the object files
were compiled with debugging information enabled.  Alternatively, you may be
able to use the @command{mpsym} command to obtain such information instead.

The program we are going to look at is a simple filter which processes its
standard input and displays the processed information on its standard output.
In this case the program converts all lowercase characters to uppercase and
removes any blank lines.  The source for the program is given below, but can
also be found in @file{tests/tutorial/test1.c}.

@smallexample

@end smallexample

If you quickly skimmed over the above code then you might have noticed some
rather obvious errors, but there are also some less obvious ones hidden there
as well.  After compiling and linking with the system C compiler and libraries
it successfully runs, even when its source code is piped to it.  So if it runs,
why bother trying to debug it?

The short answer to that is that this program does in fact contain one rather
major error that is likely to prevent it from running portably on other systems.
However, for the purposes of this tutorial, we'll pretend that we've just been
handed the source code for this program and have not worked on it before.  So
let's now try to compile and link it with the mpatrol library@footnote{On UNIX
systems with dynamic linking it might also be possible to run the program under
the @command{mpatrol} command with its @option{--dynamic} option without having
to recompile or relink, but compiling and linking with the mpatrol library is a
more generic solution across different platforms.}.

First, add the inclusion of @file{mpatrol.h} to line 34 so that we can replace
calls to @code{malloc()} and @code{free()} with their mpatrol
equivalents@footnote{This is not strictly necessary on UNIX and Windows
platforms (and AmigaOS when using @command{gcc}), but it does give us more
debugging information.}.  Then, recompile the program and link it with the
mpatrol library.  This time, running it with the @option{CHECK=-} option and
even the simplest of non-empty input lines should cause it to abort!

If you look at the @file{mpatrol.log} file produced, you should see something
along the lines of the following at the end of the log file.

@smallexample
ERROR: [FRECOR]: free memory corruption at 0x08067FF6
        0x08067FF6  00555555 55555555 5555               .UUUUUUUUU
@end smallexample

This tells us that something has written a zero byte into free memory at
location @samp{0x08067FF6}.  Unfortunately, the library only caught it at the
next call to one of its functions so it had already happened somewhere in
between the last call and the current call.  Turning on the @option{LOGALL}
option in the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable allows us to see the
last successful function call to the mpatrol library.

@smallexample

        0x080494D1 _start+33

returns 0x08067FF4
@end smallexample

Unfortunately, this only tells us that the last successful mpatrol library
function call was @code{malloc()} called from @code{strtoupper()}.  If we add
the option @option{OFLOWSIZE=8} to the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment
variable then we get slightly more information about which memory allocation was
affected@footnote{Note that the start address of the allocation has changed
slightly since we added padding around it with the @option{OFLOWSIZE} option.}.

@smallexample
ERROR: [ALLOVF]: allocation 0x08071E34 has a corrupted overflow buffer at
                 0x08071E36

        0x4007C9CB __libc_start_main+255
        0x080494D1 _start+33
@end smallexample

Now we can make a better guess about what is happening.  Since the start of
the upper overflow buffer of allocation 68 has been written to, we can assume
that something has written one byte beyond the end of that memory allocation.
You can probably see where that is happening now by looking at the code, but
let's try to be even more sure that this is what is wrong.

The only foolproof way to do this is to add a watch point to keep an eye on the
address that is being written to.  This can normally only be done within a
debugger, but on systems that support programmable software watch points, the
@option{OFLOWWATCH} option can be used to do the same thing.  For the sake of
generality, we'll use the debugger watch point approach, in this case with
@command{gdb}.  In order for the following example to work correctly you'll
need to add the @option{ALLOCSTOP=68} option to the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}
environment variable so that we can stop just after the last successful memory
allocation.

After loading the program into @command{gdb}, we need to break at @code{main()}
so that we can run to a point where all of the shared library symbols have been
loaded into memory@footnote{This is really only necessary when the mpatrol
library has been built as a shared library.}.  We can then set another
breakpoint at @code{__mp_trap()} and continue until allocation 68 has been
reached.

Because the mpatrol library has not been built with debugging information in
this example we can quickly step back to the @code{strtoupper()} function since
@command{gdb} won't step through functions that have no debugging information.
We then set a watch point on address @samp{0x8071e36}, which is the address of
the memory location that has been causing the problems.  After continuing, the
debugger stops at line 46, but this is more likely to be line 45 since that is
where a zero byte is being written to@footnote{This is not necessarily the fault
of the debugger or the debugging information generated by the compiler since
on most platforms such watch points can only be caught after they occur, hence
most debuggers show the next statement to be executed rather than the current
one.}.

So, we have located the problem, which is simply a case of not allocating
enough memory to contain the copied string @emph{and} the terminating zero byte.
We can also improve the @code{strtoupper()} function by checking the pointer
returned by @code{malloc()} to see if it is @samp{NULL}, and if so simply exit
with an error.  You can try running the program with the @option{FAILFREQ}
option to see how it would originally behave in a low memory situation.

The following listing shows the above modifications that we have made to our
program.  It can also be found in @file{tests/tutorial/test2.c}.

Leaving aside the obvious problem with @code{gets()} and the general
inefficiency of the algorithm, we could assume that our program works safely
now and we can release it to the outside world.  However, a user soon reports
a problem with our program steadily using more and more memory during its
execution when processing very large files.

This is generally attributable to a memory leak and so we can use the
@option{SHOWUNFREED} option to try to detect where the memory leak is coming
from.  Following is some example output from the mpatrol log file when our
program is run and is given a relatively small text file as input.

We can discount the first entry since that is obviously coming from when the
mpatrol library first initialises itself.  However, all of the other entries
appear to be coming from line 43 within @code{strtoupper()} and appear to be
only 1 byte in length.  At that point in the code, the only possible reason
for allocating 1 byte is when the string is empty and so that must mean that
we are not freeing memory that contains empty strings.  Looking at line 66 we
can see that @code{free()} is only ever called for non-empty strings and
therefore if we move the call to @code{free()} outside the test for an empty
string we will fix the memory leak.  The file @file{tests/tutorial/test3.c}
contains the source for the final program.

Note that we can come to the same conclusion as above in a much quicker manner
by using the @option{LEAKTABLE} option.  The following is written to the mpatrol
log file when we use that option on the same program (note that the internal
memory allocation has not automatically been added to the leak table):

@cindex mpatrol.h
@cindex MPATROL_VERSION
The mpatrol library contains implementations of dynamic memory allocation
functions for C and C++ suitable for tracing and debugging.  The library is
intended to be used without requiring any changes to existing user source code
except the inclusion of the @file{mpatrol.h} header file, although additional
functions are supplied for extra tracing and control.  Note that the current
version of the mpatrol library is contained in the @code{MPATROL_VERSION}
preprocessor macro.

@cindex NDEBUG
All of the function definitions in @file{mpatrol.h} can be disabled by defining
the @code{NDEBUG} preprocessor macro, which is the same macro used to control
the behaviour of the @code{assert()} function.  If @code{NDEBUG} is defined then
no macro redefinition of functions will take place and all special mpatrol
library functions will evaluate to empty statements.  The @file{mpalloc.h}
header file will also be included in this case.  It is intended that the
@code{NDEBUG} preprocessor macro be defined in release builds.

The @code{MP_MALLOC()} family of functions that are defined in @file{mpalloc.h}
are also defined in @file{mpatrol.h} when @code{NDEBUG} is not defined.  The
mpatrol versions of these functions contain more debugging information than the
mpalloc versions do, but they do not call the allocation failure handler when no
more memory is available (they cause the @samp{OUTMEM} error message to be given
instead).

@section C dynamic memory allocation functions

The following 19 functions are available as replacements for existing C library
functions.  To use these you must include @file{mpatrol.h} before all other
header files, although on UNIX and Windows platforms (and AmigaOS when using
@command{gcc}) they will be used anyway, albeit with slightly less tracing
information.  If @code{alloca()} is being used and @file{alloca.h} is included
then @file{mpatrol.h} must appear before @file{alloca.h} otherwise the debugging
version of @code{alloca()} will not be used.

@table @asis
@findex malloc
@item @code{void *malloc(size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably aligned
for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes
in length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated will be
implicitly rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the
heap then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set
to @code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()}
or reallocated with @code{realloc()}.

@findex calloc
@item @code{void *calloc(size_t nelem, size_t size)}
Allocates @var{nelem} elements of @var{size} zero-initialised bytes from the
heap and returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer
returned will be suitably aligned for casting to any type and can be used to
store data of up to @code{nelem * size} bytes in length.  If @code{nelem * size}
is @samp{0} then the amount of memory allocated will be implicitly rounded up to
@samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the @samp{NULL}
pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to @code{ENOMEM}.  The
allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} or reallocated with
@code{realloc()}.

@findex memalign
@item @code{void *memalign(size_t align, size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be aligned to
@var{align} bytes and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes in
length.  If @var{align} is zero then the default system alignment will be used.
If @var{align} is not a power of two then it will be rounded up to the nearest
power of two.  If @var{align} is greater than the system page size then it will
be truncated to that value.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated
will be implicitly rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in
the heap then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be
set to @code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with
@code{free()} or reallocated with @code{realloc()}, although the latter will not
guarantee the preservation of alignment.

@findex valloc
@item @code{void *valloc(size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be aligned to the
system page size and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes in
length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated will be implicitly
rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} or
reallocated with @code{realloc()}, although the latter will not guarantee the
preservation of alignment.

@findex pvalloc
@item @code{void *pvalloc(size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be aligned to the
system page size and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes in
length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated will be implicitly
rounded up to @samp{1} page, otherwise @var{size} will be implicitly rounded up
to a multiple of the system page size.  If there is not enough space in the heap
then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} or
reallocated with @code{realloc()}, although the latter will not guarantee the
preservation of alignment.

@findex alloca
@item @code{void *alloca(size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} temporary uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a
pointer to the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be
suitably aligned for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to
@var{size} bytes in length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated
will be implicitly rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in
the heap then the program will be terminated and the @samp{OUTMEM} error will be
given.  The @code{alloca()} function normally allocates its memory from the
stack, with the result that all such allocations will be freed when the function
returns.  This version of @code{alloca()} allocates its memory from the heap in
order to provide better debugging, but the allocations may not necessarily be
freed immediately when the function returns.  The allocated memory can be
deallocated explicitly with @code{dealloca()}, but may not be reallocated or
deallocated in any other way.  This function is available for backwards
compatibility with older C source code and should not be used in new code.

@findex strdup
@item @code{char *strdup(const char *str)}
Allocates exactly enough memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str} (including
the terminating nul character) and returns a pointer to the first byte of the
allocation after copying @var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.  The pointer
returned will have no alignment constraints and can be used to store character
data up to the length of @var{str}.  If @var{str} is @samp{NULL} then an error
will be given and the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If there is not
enough space in the heap then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and
@code{errno} will be set to @code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be
deallocated with @code{free()} or reallocated with @code{realloc()}.

@findex strndup
@item @code{char *strndup(const char *str, size_t size)}
Allocates exactly enough memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str} (including
the terminating nul character) and returns a pointer to the first byte of the
allocation after copying @var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.  The pointer
returned will have no alignment constraints and can be used to store character
data up to the length of @var{str}.  If @var{str} is @samp{NULL} and @var{size}
is non-zero then an error will be given and the @samp{NULL} pointer will be
returned.  If the length of @var{str} is greater than @var{size} then only
@var{size} characters will be allocated and copied, with one additional byte for
the nul character.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} or
reallocated with @code{realloc()}.  This function is available for backwards
compatibility with older C libraries and should not be used in new code.

@findex strsave
@item @code{char *strsave(const char *str)}
Allocates exactly enough memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str} (including
the terminating nul character) and returns a pointer to the first byte of the
allocation after copying @var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.  The pointer
returned will have no alignment constraints and can be used to store character
data up to the length of @var{str}.  If @var{str} is @samp{NULL} then an error
will be given and the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If there is not
enough space in the heap then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and
@code{errno} will be set to @code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be
deallocated with @code{free()} or reallocated with @code{realloc()}.  This
function is available for backwards compatibility with older C libraries and
should not be used in new code.

@findex strnsave
@item @code{char *strnsave(const char *str, size_t size)}
Allocates exactly enough memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str} (including
the terminating nul character) and returns a pointer to the first byte of the
allocation after copying @var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.  The pointer
returned will have no alignment constraints and can be used to store character
data up to the length of @var{str}.  If @var{str} is @samp{NULL} and @var{size}
is non-zero then an error will be given and the @samp{NULL} pointer will be
returned.  If the length of @var{str} is greater than @var{size} then only
@var{size} characters will be allocated and copied, with one additional byte for
the nul character.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} or
reallocated with @code{realloc()}.  This function is available for backwards
compatibility with older C libraries and should not be used in new code.

@findex strdupa
@item @code{char *strdupa(const char *str)}
Allocates exactly enough temporary memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str}
(including the terminating nul character) and returns a pointer to the first
byte of the allocation after copying @var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.
The pointer returned will have no alignment constraints and can be used to store
character data up to the length of @var{str}.  If @var{str} is @samp{NULL} then
an error will be given and the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If there
is not enough space in the heap then the program will be terminated and the
@samp{OUTMEM} error will be given.  The @code{strdupa()} function normally

@item @code{char *strndupa(const char *str, size_t size)}
Allocates exactly enough temporary memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str}
(including the terminating nul character) and returns a pointer to the first
byte of the allocation after copying @var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.
The pointer returned will have no alignment constraints and can be used to store
character data up to the length of @var{str}.  If @var{str} is @samp{NULL} and
@var{size} is non-zero then an error will be given and the @samp{NULL} pointer
will be returned.  If the length of @var{str} is greater than @var{size} then
only @var{size} characters will be allocated and copied, with one additional
byte for the nul character.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the
program will be terminated and the @samp{OUTMEM} error will be given.  The
@code{strndupa()} function normally allocates its memory from the stack, with

@findex realloc
@item @code{void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)}
Resizes the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} to @var{size} bytes and
returns a pointer to the first byte of the new allocation after copying
@var{ptr} to the newly-allocated memory, which will be truncated if @var{size}
is smaller than the original allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably
aligned for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to
@var{size} bytes in length.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then the call will be
equivalent to @code{malloc()}.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the existing
memory allocation will be freed and the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.
If @var{size} is greater than the original allocation then the extra space will
be filled with uninitialised bytes.  If there is not enough space in the heap
then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} and
can be reallocated again with @code{realloc()}.

@findex reallocf
@item @code{void *reallocf(void *ptr, size_t size)}
Resizes the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} to @var{size} bytes and
returns a pointer to the first byte of the new allocation after copying
@var{ptr} to the newly-allocated memory, which will be truncated if @var{size}
is smaller than the original allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably
aligned for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to
@var{size} bytes in length.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then the call will be

then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned, the original allocation will be
freed and @code{errno} will be set to @code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must
be deallocated with @code{free()} and can be reallocated again with
@code{realloc()}.  This function is available for backwards compatibility with
older C libraries and should not be used in new code.

@findex recalloc
@item @code{void *recalloc(void *ptr, size_t nelem, size_t size)}
Resizes the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} to @var{nelem} elements of
@var{size} bytes and returns a pointer to the first byte of the new allocation
after copying @var{ptr} to the newly-allocated memory, which will be truncated
if @code{nelem * size} is smaller than the original allocation.  The pointer
returned will be suitably aligned for casting to any type and can be used to
store data of up to @code{nelem * size} bytes in length.  If @var{ptr} is
@samp{NULL} then the call will be equivalent to @code{calloc()}.  If
@code{nelem * size} is @samp{0} then the existing memory allocation will be
freed and the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If @code{nelem * size} is
greater than the original allocation then the extra space will be filled with
zero-initialised bytes.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} and
can be reallocated again with @code{realloc()}.  This function is available for
backwards compatibility with older C libraries and @code{calloc()} and should
not be used in new code.

@findex expand
@item @code{void *expand(void *ptr, size_t size)}
Attempts to resize the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} to @var{size}
bytes and either returns @var{ptr} if there was enough space to resize it, or
@samp{NULL} if the block could not be resized for a particular reason.  If
@var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then the call will be equivalent to @code{malloc()}.
If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the existing memory allocation will be freed and
the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If @var{size} is greater than the
original allocation then the extra space will be filled with uninitialised bytes
and if @var{size} is less than the original allocation then the memory block
will be truncated.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} and
can be reallocated again with @code{realloc()}.  This function is available for
backwards compatibility with older C libraries and should not be used in new
code.

@findex free
@item @code{void free(void *ptr)}
Frees the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} so the memory can be reused
by another call to allocate memory.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then no memory
will be freed.  All of the previous contents will be destroyed.

@findex cfree
@item @code{void cfree(void *ptr, size_t nelem, size_t size)}
Frees the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} so the memory can be reused
by another call to allocate memory.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then no memory
will be freed.  All of the previous contents will be destroyed.  The @var{nelem}
and @var{size} parameters are ignored in this implementation.  This function is
available for backwards compatibility with older C libraries and @code{calloc()}
and should not be used in new code.

@findex dealloca
@item @code{void dealloca(void *ptr)}
Explicitly frees the temporary memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} so the
memory can be reused by another call to allocate memory.  If @var{ptr} is
@samp{NULL} then no memory will be freed.  All of the previous contents will be
destroyed.  This function can only be used to free memory that was allocated
with the @code{alloca()}, @code{strdupa()} and @code{strndupa()} functions, but
is only really required if the mpatrol library does not automatically free such
memory allocations when the allocating function returns.  This function is
mpatrol-specific and should not be used in release code.

@section C dynamic memory extension functions

The following 5 functions are available as replacements for existing C library
extension functions that always abort and never return @samp{NULL} if there is
insufficient memory to fulfil a request.  To use these you must include
@file{mpatrol.h} before all other header files, although on UNIX and Windows
platforms (and AmigaOS when using @command{gcc}) they will be used anyway,
albeit with slightly less tracing information.

@table @asis
@findex xmalloc
@item @code{void *xmalloc(size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably aligned
for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes
in length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated will be
implicitly rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the
heap then the program will be terminated and the @samp{OUTMEM} error will be
given.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{xfree()} or
reallocated with @code{xrealloc()}.

@findex xcalloc
@item @code{void *xcalloc(size_t nelem, size_t size)}
Allocates @var{nelem} elements of @var{size} zero-initialised bytes from the
heap and returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer
returned will be suitably aligned for casting to any type and can be used to
store data of up to @code{nelem * size} bytes in length.  If @code{nelem * size}
is @samp{0} then the amount of memory allocated will be implicitly rounded up to
@samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the program will
be terminated and the @samp{OUTMEM} error will be given.  The allocated memory
must be deallocated with @code{xfree()} or reallocated with @code{xrealloc()}.

@findex xstrdup
@item @code{char *xstrdup(const char *str)}
Allocates exactly enough memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str} (including
the terminating nul character) and returns a pointer to the first byte of the
allocation after copying @var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.  The pointer
returned will have no alignment constraints and can be used to store character
data up to the length of @var{str}.  If @var{str} is @samp{NULL} then an error
will be given and the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If there is not
enough space in the heap then the program will be terminated and the
@samp{OUTMEM} error will be given.  The allocated memory must be deallocated
with @code{xfree()} or reallocated with @code{xrealloc()}.

@findex xrealloc
@item @code{void *xrealloc(void *ptr, size_t size)}
Resizes the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} to @var{size} bytes and
returns a pointer to the first byte of the new allocation after copying
@var{ptr} to the newly-allocated memory, which will be truncated if @var{size}
is smaller than the original allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably
aligned for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to
@var{size} bytes in length.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then the call will be
equivalent to @code{xmalloc()}.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then it will be
implicitly rounded up to @samp{1}.  If @var{size} is greater than the original
allocation then the extra space will be filled with uninitialised bytes.  If
there is not enough space in the heap then the program will be terminated and
the @samp{OUTMEM} error will be given.  The allocated memory must be deallocated
with @code{xfree()} and can be reallocated again with @code{xrealloc()}.

@findex xfree
@item @code{void xfree(void *ptr)}
Frees the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} so the memory can be reused

@section C dynamic memory alternative functions

The following 6 functions are provided as convenient alternatives to the ANSI C
dynamic memory allocation functions (although @code{strdup()} is not strictly an
ANSI C function).  They are implemented as preprocessor macro functions which
may evaluate their arguments more than once, so extra care should be taken to
avoid passing arguments with side-effects.  None of the functions return
@samp{NULL} if no memory is available and instead abort the program with a
useful error message indicating where the call to allocate memory came from and
what was being allocated.  To use these you should include the @file{mpatrol.h}
or @file{mpalloc.h} header files.

@table @asis
@findex MP_MALLOC
@item @code{void *MP_MALLOC(void *ptr, size_t count, typename type)}
Allocates @var{count} uninitialised items of type @var{type} from the heap, sets
@var{ptr} to the result and returns a suitably-cast pointer to the first item of
the allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably aligned for holding items
of type @var{type}.  If @var{count} is @samp{0} then it will be implicitly
rounded up to @samp{1}.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the
program will be aborted after calling the allocation failure handler, which by
default writes an appropriate error message to the standard error file stream.
The allocated memory in @var{ptr} must be deallocated with @code{MP_FREE()} or
reallocated with @code{MP_REALLOC()}.

@findex MP_CALLOC
@item @code{void *MP_CALLOC(void *ptr, size_t count, typename type)}
Allocates @var{count} zero-initialised items of type @var{type} from the heap,
sets @var{ptr} to the result and returns a suitably-cast pointer to the first
item of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably aligned for
holding items of type @var{type}.  If @var{count} is @samp{0} then it will be
implicitly rounded up to @samp{1}.  If there is not enough space in the heap
then the program will be aborted after calling the allocation failure handler,
which by default writes an appropriate error message to the standard error file
stream.  The allocated memory in @var{ptr} must be deallocated with
@code{MP_FREE()} or reallocated with @code{MP_REALLOC()}.

@findex MP_STRDUP
@item @code{char *MP_STRDUP(char *ptr, const char *str)}
Allocates exactly enough memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str} (including
the terminating nul character), sets @var{ptr} to the result and returns a
suitably-cast pointer to the first byte of the allocation after copying
@var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.  The pointer returned will have no
alignment constraints and can be used to store character data up to the length
of @var{str}.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the program will be
aborted after calling the allocation failure handler, which by default writes an
appropriate error message to the standard error file stream.  The allocated
memory in @var{ptr} must be deallocated with @code{MP_FREE()} or reallocated
with @code{MP_REALLOC()}.

@findex MP_REALLOC
@item @code{void *MP_REALLOC(void *ptr, size_t count, typename type)}
Resizes the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} to @var{count} items of
type @var{type} and returns a suitably-cast pointer to the first item of the new
allocation after copying @var{ptr} to the newly-allocated memory, which will be
truncated if @var{count} is smaller than the original number of items.  The
pointer returned will be suitably aligned for holding items of type @var{type}.
If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then the call will be equivalent to
@code{MP_MALLOC()}.  If @var{count} is @samp{0} then it will be implicitly
rounded up to @samp{1}.  If @var{count} is greater than the original number of
items then the extra space will be filled with uninitialised bytes.  If there is
not enough space in the heap then the program will be aborted after calling the
allocation failure handler, which by default writes an appropriate error message
to the standard error file stream.  The allocated memory must be deallocated
with @code{MP_FREE()} and can be reallocated again with @code{MP_REALLOC()}.

@findex MP_FREE
@item @code{void MP_FREE(void *ptr)}
Frees the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} so the memory can be reused
by another call to allocate memory, and sets @var{ptr} to @samp{NULL} after
freeing the memory.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then no memory will be freed.

@findex MP_FAILURE
@item @code{__mp_failhandler MP_FAILURE(__mp_failhandler func)}
Installs an allocation failure handler specifically for use with
@code{MP_MALLOC()}, @code{MP_CALLOC()}, @code{MP_STRDUP()} and
@code{MP_REALLOC()} and returns a pointer to the previously installed handler,
normally the default handler if no handler had been previously installed.  This
will be called by the above functions when there is not enough space in the heap
for them to satisfy their allocation request.  The default allocation failure
handler will terminate the program after writing an error message to the
standard error file stream indicating where the original allocation request took
place and what was being allocated.

@cindex MP_DELETE
The following 5 functions are available as replacements for existing C++ library
functions, but the replacements in @file{mpatrol.h} will only be used if the
@code{MP_NOCPLUSPLUS} preprocessor macro is not defined.  The replacement
operators make use of the preprocessor in order to obtain source-level

@findex operator new
@item @code{void *operator new(size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably aligned
for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes
in length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated will be
implicitly rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the
heap then either the @code{std::bad_alloc} exception will be thrown or the
null pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to @code{ENOMEM} ---
the behaviour depends on whether the @emph{nothrow} version of the operator is
used.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{operator delete}.

@findex operator new[]
@item @code{void *operator new[](size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably aligned
for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes
in length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated will be
implicitly rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the

null pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to @code{ENOMEM} ---
the behaviour depends on whether the @emph{nothrow} version of the operator is
used.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{operator delete[]}.

@findex operator delete
@item @code{void operator delete(void *ptr)}
Frees the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} so the memory can be reused
by another call to allocate memory.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then no memory
will be freed.  All of the previous contents will be destroyed.  This function
must only be used with memory allocated by @code{operator new}.

@findex operator delete[]
@item @code{void operator delete[](void *ptr)}
Frees the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} so the memory can be reused
by another call to allocate memory.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then no memory
will be freed.  All of the previous contents will be destroyed.  This function
must only be used with memory allocated by @code{operator new[]}.

@findex set_new_handler
@item @code{std::new_handler std::set_new_handler(std::new_handler func)}
Installs a low-memory handler specifically for use with @code{operator new} and
@code{operator new[]} and returns a pointer to the previously installed handler,
or the null pointer if no handler had been previously installed.  This will be
called repeatedly by both functions when they would normally return @samp{NULL},
and this loop will continue until they manage to allocate the requested space.
Note that this function is equivalent to @code{__mp_nomemory()} and will replace
the handler installed by that function.

@findex memset
@item @code{void *memset(void *ptr, int byte, size_t size)}
Writes @var{size} bytes of value @var{byte} to the memory location beginning at
@var{ptr} and returns @var{ptr}.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then no bytes will
be written.  If the operation would affect an existing memory allocation in the

be generated in the log file and no bytes will be written.

@findex bzero
@item @code{void bzero(void *ptr, size_t size)}
Writes @var{size} zero bytes to the memory location beginning at @var{ptr}.  If
@var{size} is @samp{0} then no bytes will be written.  If the operation would
affect an existing memory allocation in the heap but would straddle that

@findex memccpy
@item @code{void *memccpy(void *dest, const void *src, int byte, size_t size)}
Copies @var{size} bytes from @var{src} to @var{dest} and returns @samp{NULL}, or
copies the number of bytes up to and including the first occurrence of
@var{byte} if @var{byte} exists within the specified range and returns a pointer
to the first byte after @var{byte}.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} or @var{src} is
the same as @var{dest} then no bytes will be copied.  The source and destination
ranges should not overlap, otherwise a warning will be written to the log file.
If the operation would affect an existing memory allocation in the heap but
would straddle that allocation's boundaries then an error message will be
generated in the log file and no bytes will be copied.

@findex memcpy
@item @code{void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t size)}

@findex memcmp
@item @code{int memcmp(const void *ptr1, const void *ptr2, size_t size)}
Compares @var{size} bytes from @var{ptr1} and @var{ptr2} and returns @samp{0} if
all of the bytes are identical, or returns the byte difference of the first
differing bytes.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} or @var{ptr1} is the same as
@var{ptr2} then no bytes will be compared.  If the operation would read from an

as being prefixed by @samp{__mp_}, their equivalent functions that are prefixed
by @samp{mpatrol_} are also defined as aliases in the @file{mpatrol.h} header
file.  To use these you should include the @file{mpatrol.h} header file.

@findex __mp_atexit
@table @asis
@item @code{int __mp_atexit(void (*func)(void))}
Installs a function to be called when the mpatrol library terminates.  Up to 32
such functions can be registered and will be called in reverse order of
registration.  Returns @samp{1} on success or @samp{0} if @var{func} could not
be registered.

@findex __mp_setoption
@item @code{unsigned long __mp_setoption(long opt, unsigned long val)}
Sets the value of an mpatrol option after the library has been initialised.
Options that require values are listed in @file{mpatrol.h} prefixed with
@samp{MP_OPT_*}.  The @var{opt} argument should be set to one of these macros,
and the @var{val} argument should be set to the option value, cast to an
unsigned integer.  The return value will be @samp{0} on success and @samp{1} on
failure.  Options that are flags are listed in @file{mpatrol.h} prefixed with
@samp{MP_FLG_*}.  Multiple flags can be set or unset at once using the
@code{MP_OPT_SETFLAGS} and @code{MP_OPT_UNSETFLAGS} options respectively, with
the necessary flags specified in @var{val}.  The return value will be @samp{0}
on success and a combination of all of the flags that could not be set or unset
on failure.

@findex __mp_getoption
@item @code{int __mp_getoption(long opt, unsigned long *val)}
Gets the value of an mpatrol option after the library has been initialised.
If @var{opt} is a valid option listed in @file{mpatrol.h} then @samp{1} will be
returned and the associated value will be returned in @var{val} and cast to an
unsigned integer, otherwise @samp{0} will be returned.  If @var{opt} is
@code{MP_OPT_SETFLAGS} then all of the mpatrol library flags that are set will
be returned in @var{val}.  If @var{opt} is @code{MP_OPT_UNSETFLAGS} then all of
the mpatrol library flags that are not set will be returned in @var{val}.

@findex __mp_libversion
@item @code{unsigned long __mp_libversion(void)}
Returns the version number of the mpatrol library.  This can be useful for
verifying that the version of the mpatrol library that a program is linked with
is the one expected at compile-time.

@findex __mp_strerror
@item @code{const char *__mp_strerror(__mp_errortype err)}
Returns the error message corresponding to the error code @var{err} or
@samp{NULL} if no such error code exists.  The most recent error code recorded
by the mpatrol library can be obtained by examining @code{__mp_errno}.

@findex __mp_function
@item @code{const char *__mp_function(__mp_alloctype func)}
Returns the name of the function corresponding to the allocation type @var{func}
or @samp{NULL} if no such allocation type exists.

@findex __mp_setuser
@item @code{int __mp_setuser(const void *ptr, const void *data)}
Sets the user data for the memory allocation containing @var{ptr}.  The contents
of @var{data} are entirely application-specific as user data will never be
examined by the mpatrol library.  Such data is associated with a memory
allocation for its entire lifetime unless overridden by a subsequent call to
@code{__mp_setuser()}.  As such, the user data must be valid for the entire
lifetime of the memory allocation, perhaps even after the allocation has been
freed if the @option{NOFREE} option is being used.  This function returns
@samp{1} if there is an allocated memory block containing @var{ptr}, and
@samp{0} otherwise.

@findex __mp_setmark
@item @code{int __mp_setmark(const void *ptr)}
Sets the marked flag for the memory allocation containing @var{ptr}, indicating
that the memory allocation cannot be freed (but can be reallocated) and thus
will not be listed as a memory leak.  This function returns @samp{1} if there is
an allocated memory block containing @var{ptr}, and @samp{0} otherwise.  Note
that a memory allocation made by @code{alloca()}, @code{strdupa()} or
@code{strndupa()} may not be marked.

@findex __mp_info
@cindex allocation information
@cindex information about an allocation
@item @code{int __mp_info(const void *ptr, __mp_allocinfo *info)}
Obtains information about a specific memory allocation by placing statistics
about @var{ptr} in @var{info}.  If @var{ptr} does not belong to a previously
allocated memory allocation or free memory block then @samp{0} will be returned,
otherwise @samp{1} will be returned and @var{info} will contain the following
information (note that a free memory block will only contain the @code{block}
and @code{size} fields and can be identified by not having the @code{allocated}
flag set):

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .8
@item @emph{Field}
@tab @emph{Description}
@item @code{block}
@tab Pointer to first byte of allocation.
@item @code{size}
@tab Size of allocation in bytes.

@tab Number of times reallocated.
@item @code{thread}
@tab Thread identifier.
@item @code{event}

@findex __mp_syminfo
@item @code{int __mp_syminfo(const void *ptr, __mp_symbolinfo *info)}
Obtains symbolic information about a specific code address by placing statistics
about @var{ptr} in @var{info}.  If @var{ptr} does not belong to a function
symbol then @samp{0} will be returned, otherwise @samp{1} will be returned and
@var{info} will contain the following information:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .8
@item @emph{Field}
@tab @emph{Description}
@item @code{name}
@tab Name of symbol.
@item @code{object}
@tab File containing symbol.
@item @code{addr}
@tab Start address of symbol.
@item @code{size}
@tab Size of symbol.
@item @code{file}
@tab Filename corresponding to address.
@item @code{line}
@tab Line number corresponding to address.
@end multitable

@findex __mp_symbol
@item @code{const char *__mp_symbol(const void *ptr)}
Obtains the name of a function symbol containing the code address specified in
@var{ptr}.  If @var{ptr} does not belong to a function symbol then @samp{NULL}
will be returned.

@findex __mp_printinfo
@item @code{int __mp_printinfo(const void *ptr)}
Displays information about a specific memory allocation containing @var{ptr} to
the standard error file stream.  If @var{ptr} does not belong to a previously
allocated memory allocation or free memory block then @samp{0} will be returned,
otherwise @samp{1} will be returned.  This function is intended to be called
from within a debugger.

@findex __mp_snapshot
@item @code{unsigned long __mp_snapshot(void)}
Returns the current event number, effectively taking a snapshot of the heap.
This number can then be used in later calls to @code{__mp_iterate()}.

@findex __mp_iterate
@item @code{size_t __mp_iterate(int (*func)(const void *, void *), void *data, unsigned long event)}
Iterates over all of the current allocated and freed memory allocations,
calling @var{func} with the start address of every memory allocation that has
been modified since event number @var{event}.  If @var{func} is @samp{NULL} then
@code{__mp_printinfo()} will be used as the callback function.  If @var{event}
is @samp{0} then @var{func} will be called with the start address of every
memory allocation.  If @var{func} returns a negative number then the iteration
process will be stopped immediately.  If @var{func} returns a positive number
above zero then @code{__mp_iterate()} will return the number of times @var{func}
returned a non-zero number after the iteration process has stopped.  The
@var{data} argument is passed directly to @var{func} as its second argument and
is not read by the mpatrol library.

@findex __mp_iterateall
@item @code{size_t __mp_iterateall(int (*func)(const void *, void *), void *data)}
Iterates over all of the current allocated and freed memory allocations and any
free memory blocks, calling @var{func} with the start address of every memory
allocation or free block.  If @var{func} is @samp{NULL} then
@code{__mp_printinfo()} will be used as the callback function.  If @var{func}
returns a negative number then the iteration process will be stopped
immediately.  If @var{func} returns a positive number above zero then
@code{__mp_iterate()} will return the number of times @var{func} returned a
non-zero number after the iteration process has stopped.  The @var{data}
argument is passed directly to @var{func} as its second argument and is not read
by the mpatrol library.  Note that unlike @code{__mp_iterate()}, this function
will also include internal memory allocations made by the mpatrol library and is
intended for walking the entire heap.

@findex __mp_addallocentry
@item @code{int __mp_addallocentry(const char *file, unsigned long line, size_t size)}
Adds an entry representing an allocation of size @var{size} to the leak table.
The allocation will be associated with a source filename of @var{file} and a
line number of @var{line} if the former is non-@samp{NULL} and the latter is
non-zero.  If @var{file} is non-@samp{NULL} and @var{line} is @samp{0} then
@var{file} represents the name of the function that made the allocation.  If
@var{file} is @samp{NULL} and @var{line} is non-zero then @var{line} represents
the code address at which the allocation was made.  If @var{file} is @samp{NULL}
and @var{line} is @samp{0} then the location of the allocation is unknown.
Returns @samp{1} on success and @samp{0} if there was no more memory available
to add another entry to the leak table.

@findex __mp_addfreeentry
@item @code{int __mp_addfreeentry(const char *file, unsigned long line, size_t size)}
Adds an entry representing a deallocation of size @var{size} to the leak table.
The deallocation will be associated with a source filename of @var{file} and a
line number of @var{line} if the former is non-@samp{NULL} and the latter is
non-zero.  If @var{file} is non-@samp{NULL} and @var{line} is @samp{0} then
@var{file} represents the name of the function that made the deallocation.  If
@var{file} is @samp{NULL} and @var{line} is non-zero then @var{line} represents
the code address at which the deallocation was made.  If @var{file} is
@samp{NULL} and @var{line} is @samp{0} then the location of the deallocation is
unknown.  Returns @samp{1} on success and @samp{0} if there was no existing
allocation from the same location in the leak table.

@findex __mp_clearleaktable
@item @code{void __mp_clearleaktable(void)}
Deletes all of the existing entries in the leak table, making it empty.  This
will also affect the behaviour of the @option{LEAKTABLE} option since that
option will then only be able to show a summary of the entries in the leak table
that were collected after the last call to this function rather than from the
start of program execution.

@findex __mp_startleaktable
@item @code{int __mp_startleaktable(void)}
Starts the automatic logging of all memory allocations, reallocations and
deallocations to the leak table.  Returns @samp{1} if such logging was already
being performed and @samp{0} otherwise.

@findex __mp_stopleaktable
@item @code{int __mp_stopleaktable(void)}
Stops the automatic logging of all memory allocations, reallocations and
deallocations to the leak table.  Returns @samp{1} if such logging was already
being performed and @samp{0} otherwise.

@findex __mp_leaktable
@item @code{void __mp_leaktable(size_t size, int opt, unsigned char flags)}
Displays a summary of up to @var{size} entries from the leak table, or all
entries if @var{size} is @samp{0}.  If @var{opt} is @code{MP_LT_ALLOCATED} then
all allocated entries will be displayed, if @var{opt} is @code{MP_LT_FREED} then
all freed entries will be displayed and if @var{opt} is @code{MP_LT_UNFREED}
then all unfreed entries will be displayed.  The summary is normally sorted in
descending order of total bytes from each entry, but this can be changed by
setting @var{flags} to any combination of @code{MP_LT_COUNTS} (to sort by the
number of occurrences in each entry) and @code{MP_LT_BOTTOM} (to sort in
ascending order).

@findex __mp_memorymap
@item @code{void __mp_memorymap(int stats)}
If @var{stats} is non-zero then the current statistics of the mpatrol library
will be displayed.  If the heap contains at least one allocated, freed or free
block then a map of the current heap will also be displayed.

@findex __mp_summary
@item @code{void __mp_summary(void)}
Displays information about the current state of the mpatrol library, including
its settings and any relevant statistics.

@findex __mp_stats
@item @code{int __mp_stats(__mp_heapinfo *info)}
Obtains statistics about the current state of the heap and places them in
@var{info}.  If this information could not be determined then @samp{0} will be
returned, otherwise @samp{1} will be returned and @var{info} will contain the
following information:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .8
@item @emph{Field}
@tab @emph{Description}
@item @code{acount}
@tab Total number of allocated blocks.

@item @code{itotal}
@tab Total size of internal blocks.
@item @code{mcount}
@tab Total number of marked blocks.
@item @code{mtotal}
@tab Total size of marked blocks.
@end multitable

@findex __mp_check
@item @code{void __mp_check(void)}
Forces the library to perform an immediate check of the overflow buffers of
every memory allocation and to ensure that nothing has overwritten any free
blocks.  If any memory allocations made by the @code{alloca()} family of
functions are out of scope then this function will also cause them to be freed.

@findex __mp_prologue
@item @code{__mp_prologuehandler __mp_prologue(const __mp_prologuehandler func)}
Installs a prologue function to be called before any memory allocation,
reallocation or deallocation function.  This function will return a pointer to
the previously installed prologue function, or the null pointer if no prologue
function had been previously installed.  The following arguments will be used to
call the prologue function (the last four arguments contain the function name,
file name, line number and the return address of the calling function, or null
pointers and zero if they cannot be determined):

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .2 .2 .4
@item @emph{Argument 1}
@tab @emph{Argument 2}
@tab @emph{Argument 3}
@tab @emph{Called by}

@tab @code{0}
@tab @code{free()}, etc.
@item @var{ptr}
@tab @code{-2}
@tab @code{1}
@tab @code{strdup()}, etc.
@end multitable

@findex __mp_epilogue
@item @code{__mp_epiloguehandler __mp_epilogue(const __mp_epiloguehandler func)}
Installs an epilogue function to be called after any memory allocation,
reallocation or deallocation function.  This function will return a pointer to
the previously installed epilogue function, or the null pointer if no epilogue
function had been previously installed.  The following arguments will be used to
call the epilogue function (the last four arguments contain the function name,
file name, line number and the return address of the calling function, or null
pointers and zero if they cannot be determined):

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .8
@item @emph{Argument}
@tab @emph{Called by}
@item @var{ptr}
@tab @code{malloc()}, @code{realloc()}, @code{strdup()}, etc.
@item @code{-1}
@tab @code{free()}, etc.
@end multitable

@findex __mp_nomemory
@item @code{__mp_nomemoryhandler __mp_nomemory(const __mp_nomemoryhandler func)}
Installs a low-memory handler and returns a pointer to the previously installed
handler, or the @samp{NULL} pointer if no handler had been previously installed.
This will be called once by C memory allocation functions, and repeatedly by C++
memory allocation functions, when they would normally return @samp{NULL}.  The
four arguments contain the function name, file name, line number and the return
address of the calling function, or null pointers and zero if they cannot be
determined.  Note that this function is equivalent to @code{set_new_handler()}
and will replace the handler installed by that function.

@findex __mp_printf
@item @code{int __mp_printf(const char *fmt, ...)}
Writes format string @var{fmt} with variable arguments to the log file, with
each line prefixed by @samp{>}.  The final length of the string that is written
to the log file must not exceed 1024 characters.  Returns the number of
characters written, or a negative number upon error.

@findex __mp_vprintf
@item @code{int __mp_vprintf(const char *fmt, va_list args)}
Writes format string @var{fmt} with variable argument list @var{args} to the log
file, with each line prefixed by @samp{>}.  The final length of the string that
is written to the log file must not exceed 1024 characters.  Returns the number
of characters written, or a negative number upon error.

@findex __mp_locprintf
@item @code{void __mp_locprintf(const char *fmt, ...)}
Writes format string @var{fmt} with variable arguments to the log file, with
each line prefixed by @samp{>}.  The final length of the string that is written
to the log file must not exceed 1024 characters.  It also writes information to
the log file about where the call to this function was made, which includes the
source file location and the call stack if they are available.

@findex __mp_vlocprintf
@item @code{void __mp_vlocprintf(const char *fmt, va_list args)}
Writes format string @var{fmt} with variable argument list @var{args} to the log
file, with each line prefixed by @samp{>}.  The final length of the string that
is written to the log file must not exceed 1024 characters.  It also writes
information to the log file about where the call to this function was made,
which includes the source file location and the call stack if they are
available.

@findex __mp_logmemory
@item @code{void __mp_logmemory(const void *ptr, size_t size)}
Displays the contents of a block of memory beginning at @var{ptr}, dumping
@var{size} consecutive bytes to the log file in hexadecimal format.

@findex __mp_logstack
@item @code{int __mp_logstack(size_t frames)}
Displays the current call stack, skipping @var{frames} stack frames from the
current stack frame before writing the symbolic stack trace to the log file.
Returns @samp{1} if successful, or @samp{0} if the call stack could not be
determined or if @var{frames} was too large for the current call stack.

@findex __mp_logaddr
@item @code{int __mp_logaddr(const void *ptr)}
Displays information about a specific memory allocation containing @var{ptr} to
the log file.  If @var{ptr} does not belong to a previously allocated memory
allocation then @samp{0} will be returned, otherwise @samp{1} will be returned.

@findex __mp_edit
@item @code{int __mp_edit(const char *file, unsigned long line)}
Invokes a text editor to edit @var{file} at line number @var{line} via the
@command{mpedit} command.  Returns @samp{1} if the text editor was successfully
invoked, @samp{-1} if there was an error, or @samp{0} if there is no support for
this feature.  This function will only work on a system where the @option{EDIT}
option works.

@findex __mp_list
@item @code{int __mp_list(const char *file, unsigned long line)}
Displays a context listing of @var{file} at line number @var{line} via the
@command{mpedit} command.  Returns @samp{1} if the listing was successfully
performed, @samp{-1} if there was an error, or @samp{0} if there is no support
for this feature.  This function will only work on a system where the
@option{LIST} option works.

@findex __mp_view
@item @code{int __mp_view(const char *file, unsigned long line)}
Either invokes a text editor to edit @var{file} at line number @var{line} or
displays a context listing of @var{file} at line number @var{line} depending
on the setting of the @option{EDIT} and @option{LIST} options.  This is done via
the @command{mpedit} command and will have no effect if the @option{EDIT} and
@option{LIST} options are not set or if these options are not supported on the
system.  Returns @samp{1} if the edit or listing was successfully performed,
@samp{-1} if there was an error, or @samp{0} if neither of the options were set
or if there is no support for this feature.

@findex __mp_readcontents
@item @code{int __mp_readcontents(const char *file, void *ptr)}
Reads the contents of a memory allocation contents file into the memory
allocation containing @var{ptr}.  The name of the file is composed of the
@var{file} string followed by the allocation index of the memory allocation
separated by a dot.  If @var{file} is @samp{NULL} then it is assumed to be
@file{.mpatrol}.  Returns @samp{1} if the contents were read successfully and
@samp{0} otherwise.

@findex __mp_writecontents
@item @code{int __mp_writecontents(const char *file, const void *ptr)}

Compares the contents of the memory allocation containing @var{ptr} with the
contents of a previously written allocation contents file.  The name of the file
is composed of the @var{file} string followed by the allocation index of the
memory allocation separated by a dot.  If @var{file} is @samp{NULL} then it is
assumed to be @file{.mpatrol}.  Any differences are written to the mpatrol log
file.  Returns the number of differences found, or @samp{-1} if there was an
error.

@findex __mp_remcontents
@item @code{int __mp_remcontents(const char *file, const void *ptr)}

@node Environment, Options, Functions, Top
@appendix Environment
@cindex environment

@cindex MPATROL_OPTIONS
The library can read certain options at run-time from an environment variable
called @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}.  This variable must contain one or more valid
option keywords from the list below and must be no longer than 1024 characters
in length.  If @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} is unset or empty then the default settings
will be used.

@cindex binary
@cindex octal
@cindex decimal
@cindex hexadecimal
The syntax for options specified within the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment
variable is @samp{OPTION} or @samp{OPTION=VALUE}, where @samp{OPTION} is a
keyword from the list below and @samp{VALUE} is the setting for that option.  If
@samp{VALUE} is numeric then it may be specified using binary, octal, decimal or
hexadecimal notation, with binary notation beginning with either @samp{0b} or
@samp{0B}.  If @samp{VALUE} is a character string containing spaces then it may
be quoted using double quotes.  No whitespace may appear between the @samp{=}
sign, but whitespace must appear between different options.  Note that option
keywords can be given in lowercase as well as uppercase, or a mixture of both.

@table @asis
@cindex ALLOCBYTE
@item @option{ALLOCBYTE}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies an 8-bit byte pattern with which to prefill newly-allocated memory.
This can be used to detect the use of memory which has not been initialised
after allocation.  Note that this setting will not affect memory allocated with
@code{calloc()} or @code{recalloc()} as these functions always prefill allocated
memory with an 8-bit byte pattern of zero.  Default value:
@option{ALLOCBYTE=0xFF}.

@cindex ALLOCSTOP
@item @option{ALLOCSTOP}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies an allocation index at which to stop the program when it is being
allocated.  When the number of memory allocations reaches this number the
program will be halted, and its state may be examined at that point by using a
suitable debugger.  Note that this setting will be ignored if its value is zero.
Default value: @option{ALLOCSTOP=0}.

@cindex ALLOWOFLOW
@item @option{ALLOWOFLOW}
Specifies that a warning rather than an error should be produced if any memory
operation function overflows the boundaries of a memory allocation, and that
the operation should still be performed.  This option is provided for
circumstances where it is desirable for the memory operation to be performed,
regardless of whether it is erroneous or not.

@cindex AUTOSAVE
@item @option{AUTOSAVE}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the frequency at which to periodically write the profiling data to
the profiling output file.  When the total number of profiled memory allocations
and deallocations is a multiple of this number then the current profiling
information will be written to the profiling output file.  This option can be
used to instruct the mpatrol library to dump out any profiling information just
before a fatal error occurs in a program, for example.  Note that this setting
will be ignored if its value is zero.  Default value: @option{AUTOSAVE=0}.

@cindex CHECK
@item @option{CHECK}=<@var{unsigned-range}>
Specifies a range of allocation indices at which to check the integrity of free
memory and overflow buffers.  The range must be specified as no more than two
unsigned integers separated by a dash, followed by an optional forward slash and
an unsigned integer specifying an event checking frequency.  If numbers on
either the left side or the right side of the dash are omitted then they will be
assumed to be @samp{0} and @var{infinity} respectively.  A value of @samp{0} on
its own indicates that no such checking will ever be performed.  This option can
be used to speed up the execution speed of the library at the expense of
checking.  Default value: @option{CHECK=0}.

@cindex CHECKALL
@item @option{CHECKALL}
Equivalent to the @option{CHECKALLOCS}, @option{CHECKREALLOCS},
@option{CHECKFREES} and @option{CHECKMEMORY} options specified together.

@cindex CHECKALLOCS
@item @option{CHECKALLOCS}
Checks that no attempt is made to allocate a block of memory of size zero.  A
warning will be issued for every such case.

@cindex CHECKFORK
@item @option{CHECKFORK}
Checks at every call to see if the process has been forked in case new log,
profiling and tracing output files need to be started.  This option only has an
effect on UNIX platforms, but should not be used in multithreaded programs if
each thread has a different process identifier.

@cindex CHECKFREES
@item @option{CHECKFREES}
Checks that no attempt is made to deallocate a @samp{NULL} pointer.  A warning
will be issued for every such case.

@cindex CHECKMEMORY
@item @option{CHECKMEMORY}
Checks that no attempt is made to perform a zero-length memory operation or a
memory operation on a @samp{NULL} pointer.

@cindex CHECKREALLOCS
@item @option{CHECKREALLOCS}
Checks that no attempt is made to reallocate a @samp{NULL} pointer or resize an
existing block of memory to size zero.  Warnings will be issued for every such
case.

@cindex DEFALIGN
@item @option{DEFALIGN}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the default alignment for general-purpose memory allocations, which
must be a power of two (and will be rounded up to the nearest power of two if it
is not).  The default alignment for a particular system is calculated at
run-time.

@cindex EDIT
@item @option{EDIT}
Specifies that a text editor should be invoked to edit any relevant source files
that are associated with any warnings or errors when they occur.  Only
diagnostics which occur at source lines in the program will be affected and only
then if they contain source-level information.  This option is currently only
available on UNIX platforms as it makes use of the @command{mpedit} command.  It
also overrides the behaviour of the @option{LIST} option and affects the
behaviour of the @code{__mp_view()} function.

@cindex FAILFREQ
@item @option{FAILFREQ}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the frequency at which all memory allocations will randomly fail.  For
example, a value of @samp{10} will mean that roughly 1 in 10 memory allocations
will fail, but a value of @samp{0} will disable all random failures.  This
option can be useful for stress-testing an application.  Default value:
@option{FAILFREQ=0}.

@cindex FAILSEED
@item @option{FAILSEED}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the random number seed which will be used when determining which
memory allocations will randomly fail.  A value of @samp{0} will instruct the
library to pick a random seed every time it is run.  Any other value will mean
that the random failures will be the same every time the program is run, but
only as long as the seed stays the same.  Default value: @option{FAILSEED=0}.

@cindex FREEBYTE
@item @option{FREEBYTE}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies an 8-bit byte pattern with which to prefill newly-freed memory.  This
can be used to detect the use of memory which has just been freed.  It is also
used internally to ensure that freed memory has not been overwritten.  Note that
the freed memory may be reused the next time a block of memory is allocated and
so once memory has been freed its contents are not guaranteed to remain the same
as the specified byte pattern.  Default value: @option{FREEBYTE=0x55}.

@cindex FREESTOP
@item @option{FREESTOP}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies an allocation index at which to stop the program when it is being
freed.  When the memory allocation with the specified allocation index is to be
freed the program will be halted, and its state may be examined at that point
using a suitable debugger.  Note that this setting will be ignored if its value
is zero.  Default value: @option{FREESTOP=0}.

@cindex HELP
@cindex option summary
@cindex summary of options
@item @option{HELP}
Displays a quick-reference option summary to the @code{stderr} file stream.

@cindex LARGEBOUND
@item @option{LARGEBOUND}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the limit in bytes up to which memory allocations should be classified
as large allocations for profiling purposes.  This limit must be greater than
the small and medium bounds.  Default value: @option{LARGEBOUND=2048}.

@cindex LEAKTABLE
@item @option{LEAKTABLE}
Specifies that the leak table should be automatically used and a leak table
summary should be displayed at the end of program execution.  The summary shows
a flat profile of all unfreed memory allocations since the start of the program,
or since the last call to @code{__mp_clearleaktable()} if that function was
called.

@cindex LIMIT
@item @option{LIMIT}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the limit in bytes at which all memory allocations should fail if the
total allocated memory should increase beyond this.  This can be used to
stress-test software to see how it behaves in low memory conditions.  The
internal memory used by the library itself will not be counted as part of the
total heap size, but on some systems there may be a small amount of memory
required to initialise the library itself.  Note that this setting will be
ignored if its value is zero.  Default value: @option{LIMIT=0}.

@cindex LIST
@item @option{LIST}
Specifies that a context listing should be shown for any relevant source files
that are associated with any warnings or errors when they occur.  Only
diagnostics which occur at source lines in the program will be affected and only
then if they contain source-level information.  This option is currently only
available on UNIX platforms as it makes use of the @command{mpedit} command.  It
also overrides the behaviour of the @option{EDIT} option and affects the
behaviour of the @code{__mp_view()} function.

@cindex LOGALL
@item @option{LOGALL}
Equivalent to the @option{LOGALLOCS}, @option{LOGREALLOCS}, @option{LOGFREES}
and @option{LOGMEMORY} options specified together.

@cindex LOGALLOCS
@item @option{LOGALLOCS}
Specifies that all memory allocations are to be logged and sent to the log file.
Note that any memory allocations made internally by the library will not be
logged.

@cindex LOGFILE
@cindex LOGDIR
@item @option{LOGFILE}=<@var{string}>
Specifies an alternative file in which to place all diagnostics from the mpatrol
library.  If the @env{LOGDIR} environment variable is set and the specified file
does not contain a path component in its filename then the log file will be
located in the directory specified in @env{LOGDIR}.  A filename of @samp{stderr}
will send all diagnostics to the @code{stderr} file stream and a filename of
@samp{stdout} will do the equivalent with the @code{stdout} file stream.  Note
that if a problem occurs while opening the log file or if any diagnostics
require to be displayed before the log file has had a chance to be opened then
they will be sent to the @code{stderr} file stream.  Default value:
@option{LOGFILE=mpatrol.log} or @option{LOGFILE=%n.%p.log} if the @env{LOGDIR}
environment variable is set.

@cindex LOGFREES
@item @option{LOGFREES}
Specifies that all memory deallocations are to be logged and sent to the log
file.  Note that any memory deallocations made internally by the library will
not be logged.

@cindex LOGMEMORY
@item @option{LOGMEMORY}
Specifies that all memory operations are to be logged and sent to the log file.
These operations will be made by calls to functions such as @code{memset()} and
@code{memcpy()}.  Note that any memory operations made internally by the library
will not be logged.

@cindex LOGREALLOCS
@item @option{LOGREALLOCS}
Specifies that all memory reallocations are to be logged and sent to the log
file.  Note that any memory reallocations made internally by the library will
not be logged.

@cindex MEDIUMBOUND
@item @option{MEDIUMBOUND}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the limit in bytes up to which memory allocations should be classified
as medium allocations for profiling purposes.  This limit must be greater than
the small bound but less than the large bound.  Default value:
@option{MEDIUMBOUND=256}.

@cindex NOFREE
@item @option{NOFREE}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies that a number of recently-freed memory allocations should be prevented
from being returned to the free memory pool.  Such freed memory allocations will
then be flagged as freed and can be used by the library to provide better
diagnostics.  If the size of the freed queue is specified as zero then all
freed memory will be immediately reused by the mpatrol library.  Note that if
this option is given a non-zero value then the mpatrol library will always force
a memory reallocation to return a pointer to newly-allocated memory, but the
@code{expand()} function will never be affected by this option.  Default value:
@option{NOFREE=0}.

@cindex NOPROTECT
@item @option{NOPROTECT}
Specifies that the mpatrol library's internal data structures should not be made
read-only after every memory allocation, reallocation or deallocation.  This may
significantly speed up execution but this will be at the expense of less safety
if the program accidentally overwrites some of the library's internal data
structures.  Note that this option has no effect on systems that do not support
memory protection.

@cindex OFLOWBYTE
@item @option{OFLOWBYTE}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies an 8-bit byte pattern with which to fill the overflow buffers of all
memory allocations.  This is used internally to ensure that nothing has been
written beyond the beginning or the end of a block of allocated memory.  Note
that this setting will only have an effect if the @option{OFLOWSIZE} option is
in use.  Default value: @option{OFLOWBYTE=0xAA}.

@cindex OFLOWSIZE
@item @option{OFLOWSIZE}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the size in bytes to use for all overflow buffers, which must be a
power of two (and will be rounded up to the nearest power of two if it is not).
This is used internally to ensure that nothing has been written beyond the
beginning or the end of a block of allocated memory.  Note that this setting
specifies the size for only one of the overflow buffers given to each memory
allocation; the other overflow buffer will have an identical size.  No overflow
buffers will be used if this setting is zero.  Default value:
@option{OFLOWSIZE=0}.

@cindex OFLOWWATCH
@item @option{OFLOWWATCH}
Specifies that watch point areas should be used for overflow buffers rather than
filling with the overflow byte.  This can significantly reduce the speed of
program execution.  Note that this option has no effect on systems that do not
support watch point areas.

@cindex PAGEALLOC
@item @option{PAGEALLOC}=<@option{LOWER}|@option{UPPER}>
Specifies that each individual memory allocation should occupy at least one
page of virtual memory and should be placed at the lowest or highest point
within these pages.  This allows the library to place an overflow buffer of one
page on either side of every memory allocation and write-protect these pages as
well as all free and freed memory.  Note that this option has no effect on
systems that do not support memory protection, and is disabled by default on
other systems as it can slow down the speed of program execution.

@cindex PRESERVE
@item @option{PRESERVE}
Specifies that any reallocated or freed memory allocations should preserve their
original contents.  This option must be used with the @option{NOFREE} option and
has no effect otherwise.

@cindex PROF
@item @option{PROF}
Specifies that all memory allocations and deallocations are to be profiled and
sent to the profiling output file.  Memory reallocations are treated as a
memory deallocation immediately followed by a memory allocation.

@cindex PROFFILE
@cindex PROFDIR
@item @option{PROFFILE}=<@var{string}>
Specifies an alternative file in which to place all memory allocation profiling
information from the mpatrol library.  If the @env{PROFDIR} environment variable
is set and the specified file does not contain a path component in its filename
then the profiling output file will be located in the directory specified in
@env{PROFDIR}.  A filename of @samp{stderr} will send this information to the
@code{stderr} file stream and a filename of @samp{stdout} will do the equivalent
with the @code{stdout} file stream.  Note that if a problem occurs while opening
the profiling output file then the profiling information will not be output.
Default value: @option{PROFFILE=mpatrol.out} or @option{PROFFILE=%n.%p.out} if
the @env{PROFDIR} environment variable is set.

@cindex PROGFILE
@item @option{PROGFILE}=<@var{string}>
Specifies an alternative filename with which to locate the executable file
containing the program's symbols.  On most systems, the library will
automatically be able to determine this filename, but on a few systems this
option may have to be used before any or all symbols can be read.

@cindex REALLOCSTOP
@item @option{REALLOCSTOP}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies a reallocation index at which to stop the program when a memory
allocation is being reallocated.  If the @option{ALLOCSTOP} option is non-zero
then the program will be halted when the allocation matching that allocation
index is reallocated the specified number of times.  Otherwise the program will
be halted the first time any allocation is reallocated the specified number of
times.  Note that this setting will be ignored if its value is zero.  Default
value: @option{REALLOCSTOP=0}.

@cindex SAFESIGNALS
@item @option{SAFESIGNALS}
Instructs the library to save and replace certain signal handlers during the
execution of library code and to restore them afterwards.  This was the default
behaviour in version 1.0 of the mpatrol library and was changed since some
memory-intensive programs became very hard to interrupt using the keyboard,
thus giving the impression that the program or system had hung.

@cindex SHOWALL
@item @option{SHOWALL}
Equivalent to the @option{SHOWFREE}, @option{SHOWFREED}, @option{SHOWUNFREED},
@option{SHOWMAP} and @option{SHOWSYMBOLS} options specified together.

@cindex SHOWFREE
@item @option{SHOWFREE}
Specifies that a summary of all of the free memory blocks should be displayed at
the end of program execution.  This step will not be performed if an abnormal
termination occurs or if there were no free memory blocks.

@cindex SHOWFREED
@item @option{SHOWFREED}
Specifies that a summary of all of the freed memory allocations should be
displayed at the end of program execution.  This option must be used in
conjunction with the @option{NOFREE} option and this step will not be performed
if an abnormal termination occurs or if there were no freed allocations.

@cindex SHOWMAP
@item @option{SHOWMAP}
Specifies that a memory map of the entire heap should be displayed at the end of
program execution.  This step will not be performed if an abnormal termination
occurs or if the heap is empty.

@cindex SHOWSYMBOLS
@item @option{SHOWSYMBOLS}
Specifies that a summary of all of the function symbols read from the program's
executable file should be displayed at the end of program execution.  This step
will not be performed if an abnormal termination occurs or if no symbols could
be read from the executable file.

@cindex SHOWUNFREED
@item @option{SHOWUNFREED}
Specifies that a summary of all of the unfreed memory allocations should be
displayed at the end of program execution.  This step will not be performed if
an abnormal termination occurs or if there are no unfreed allocations.  Note
that any marked memory allocations will not be listed.

@cindex SMALLBOUND
@item @option{SMALLBOUND}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the limit in bytes up to which memory allocations should be classified
as small allocations for profiling purposes.  This limit must be greater than
zero but less than the medium and large bounds.  Default value:
@option{SMALLBOUND=32}.

@cindex TRACE
@item @option{TRACE}
Specifies that all memory allocations, reallocations and deallocations are to be
traced and sent to the tracing output file.

@cindex TRACEFILE
@cindex TRACEDIR
@item @option{TRACEFILE}=<@var{string}>
Specifies an alternative file in which to place all memory allocation tracing
information from the mpatrol library.  If the @env{TRACEDIR} environment
variable is set and the specified file does not contain a path component in its
filename then the tracing output file will be located in the directory specified
in @env{TRACEDIR}.  A filename of @samp{stderr} will send this information to
the @code{stderr} file stream and a filename of @samp{stdout} will do the
equivalent with the @code{stdout} file stream.  Note that if a problem occurs
while opening the tracing output file then the tracing information will not be
output.  Default value: @option{TRACEFILE=mpatrol.trace} or
@option{TRACEFILE=%n.%p.trace} if the @env{TRACEDIR} environment variable is
set.

@cindex UNFREEDABORT
@item @option{UNFREEDABORT}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the minimum number of unfreed allocations at which to abort the
program just before program termination.  A summary of all the allocations will
be displayed on the standard error file stream before aborting.  This option may
be handy for use in batch tests as it can force tests to fail if they do not
free up a minimum number of memory allocations, although marked allocations will
not be considered as unfreed allocations.  Note that this setting will be
ignored if its value is zero.  Default value: @option{UNFREEDABORT=0}.

@cindex USEDEBUG
@item @option{USEDEBUG}
Specifies that any debugging information in the executable file should be used
to obtain additional source-level information.  This option will only have an
effect if the executable file contains a compiler-generated line number table
and will be ignored if the mpatrol library was built to support an object file
access library that cannot read line tables from object files.  Note that this
option will slow down program execution, use up more system memory and may leave
unaccounted unfreed memory allocations at program termination.

@cindex USEMMAP
@item @option{USEMMAP}
Specifies that the library should use @code{mmap()} instead of @code{sbrk()} to
allocate user memory on UNIX platforms.  This option should be used if there
are problems when using the mpatrol library in combination with another malloc
library which uses @code{sbrk()} to allocate its memory.  Memory internal to the
mpatrol library is allocated with @code{mmap()} on systems where it is supported
in order to segregate it from user memory, and this behaviour is reversed with
the @option{USEMMAP} option.  It is ignored on systems that do not support the
@code{mmap()} system call.  Note that some UNIX systems require this option in
order for the mpatrol library to be able to perform memory protection with the
@code{mprotect()} system call.

@appendix Options
@cindex options
@cindex command line options

A utility program called @command{mpatrol} is provided to run commands that have
been linked with the mpatrol library.

@smallexample
mpatrol [options] <command> [arguments]
@end smallexample

The @command{mpatrol} command is used to set various mpatrol library
@var{options} when running @var{command} with its @var{arguments}.  In most
cases, @var{command} must have been linked with the mpatrol library, unless the
@option{--dynamic} option is used in which case @var{command} need only have
been dynamically linked.

@cindex process id
All mpatrol library diagnostics are sent to the file @file{mpatrol.%n.log} in
the current directory by default (where @samp{%n} is the current process id) but
this can be changed using the @option{--log-file} option.  Similarly, the
default profiling output filename is @file{mpatrol.%n.out} and the default
tracing output filename is @file{mpatrol.%n.trace}.

Alternatively, the log file, profiling output file and tracing output file names
can contain @samp{%p}, which will be replaced with the name of the program being
executed without the directory components.  If the executable filename could not
be determined or was not set then it will be replaced with @samp{mpatrol}.  A
similar replacement character sequence is @samp{%f}, which will be replaced by
the pathname of the program being executed, with all path separation characters
replaced by underscores.

The current date can be entered into such filenames through the use of the
@samp{%d} character sequence, which will be replaced with the date in the form
@samp{YYYYMMDD}.  The current time can be added with @samp{%t}, which will be
replaced with the time in the form @samp{HHMMSS}.  If the date or time could not
be determined, these will be replaced with @samp{today} and @samp{now}
respectively.

All of the following options (except @option{--dynamic}, @option{--help},
@option{--read-env}, @option{--show-env}, @option{--threads} and
@option{--version}) correspond to their listed mpatrol library option
(@pxref{Environment}).  Note that some of these options have a one character
equivalent option that can be used for brevity.  The list of one character
options can be viewed with the @option{--help} option or viewed in the UNIX
manual pages.  Such options are parsed on the command line in a similar way to
the UNIX function @code{getopt()}.

@appendix Diagnostic messages
@cindex diagnostic messages
@cindex warnings
@cindex errors

The following table lists the warnings and errors that are likely to appear in
the mpatrol log file when problems with dynamic memory allocations and memory
operations occur.  Other types of warnings and errors may also appear in the log
file, but they are likely to be associated with parsing options and reading
symbols from executable files and so should be self-explanatory.

In all cases, if a warning or error is caused by one of the memory access
checking functions (invoked through the use of the @option{-fcheck-memory-usage}
option to the GNU compiler) then execution will halt regardless, despite what
the description of the diagnostic message says.

If a warning or error occurs due to a direct call to an mpatrol library function
then an attempt will be made to provide a log entry for the call.  If the
diagnostic was not caused by a normal memory allocation, reallocation or
deallocation function then the log entry will be preceded by @samp{LOG:}.  The
function type will be listed as @samp{check} if it does not fall into the normal
categories or if not enough information is available.

Note that on UNIX platforms, if the diagnostic message is caused by a line in
the program source then the @option{EDIT} and @option{LIST} options can be used
to illustrate more clearly where in the source code the warning or error
occurred.

Something has corrupted the overflow buffer of a memory allocation and this has
been caught at the next invocation of an mpatrol function when the

The following times were obtained on a Sun Ultra 5 with an UltraSPARC IIi
processor running at 333MHz and running Solaris 7.  The test performed was the
one in @file{tests/pass/test1.c} and all tests were run on a lightly loaded
system, but were run several times to obtain an average result.  Obviously,
these times can only be an approximation, but should serve to illustrate the
effects on performance that each option can have.  All times are given in
seconds, and the second time on each line was obtained with the same options
plus the @option{NOPROTECT} option.  The tests were all run with the default
@option{CHECK=0} option, so running with the @option{CHECK=-} option would slow

There is a problem obtaining the program's executable filename when using the

@item
The shared library version of mpatrol does not currently override the dynamic
memory allocation functions that are called from other shared libraries and so
will only affect object files that are statically linked.  If this is a problem
then should link your programs with the following additional compiler options in
order to perform a static link instead of a dynamic link: @option{-bnoautoimp}
@option{-bimport:/lib/syscalls.exp} and also @option{-bimport:/lib/threads.exp}
if linking with @file{libmpatrolmt.a}.
@item

@node Porting, Notes, Supported systems, Top
@appendix Porting
@cindex porting

This section describes how to port the mpatrol library to new systems.  It is
not a complete set of guidelines as nothing can cover every eventuality, but it
should list most of the important issues and where to make the necessary
changes.  Once you've made the changes (and are happy with them) then send them
to me and I can incorporate them into the next mpatrol release.  I'd also like
to hear from anybody who has got mpatrol working on a different version of an
operating system listed in the supported systems section (@pxref{Supported
systems}) even if no changes were required, since that information can be useful
for new users wondering if mpatrol can be used on their system.

@enumerate 1
@item
Make any required changes in @file{src/target.h} in order to identify the new
system.

The @code{TARGET} macro is used to identify distinct families of operating
systems whereas the @code{SYSTEM} macro is used to identify the operating system
variant if @code{TARGET=TARGET_UNIX}.  You should try to identify the predefined
preprocessor macros that the system C compiler defines for the operating system
type and the operating system variant, otherwise you will have to specify the
@code{TARGET} and @code{SYSTEM} macros explicitly in the @file{Makefile} when
building the mpatrol library.  Note that for non-UNIX operating systems,
@code{SYSTEM=SYSTEM_ANY} is implied.

The @code{ARCH} macro is used to identify the processor architecture and the
@code{ENVIRON} macro is used to identify the processor word size.  Again, you
should try to identify the predefined preprocessor macros that the system C
compiler defines for the processor architecture and processor word size,
otherwise you may also have to specify the @code{ARCH} and @code{ENVIRON}
macros explicitly in the @file{Makefile} when building the mpatrol library.  The
default setting for the processor word size is @code{ENVIRON=ENVIRON_32}.

You can normally figure out the preprocessor macros that are predefined by the
system C compiler by using the @option{-#}, @option{-v} or @option{-verbose}
options when compiling a source file.  The command line used to invoke the
preprocessor should then be shown, which should show a list of all of the macros
that are being defined in addition to those specified on the compiler command
line.  It should then be easy for you to spot the ones you need.

The @code{FORMAT} macro is used to identify the object file format and the
@code{DYNLINK} macro is used to identify the dynamic linker type.  You may be
able to use the existing values for these without having to define new ones,
but in any case you should attempt to set defaults for these macros depending
on the values of the four preceding macros.  A setting of
@code{FORMAT=FORMAT_NONE} indicates that reading symbols from any object files
is not supported and a setting of @code{DYNLINK=DYNLINK_NONE} indicates that
reading symbols from shared libraries is not supported.

If the object file format of the new system is not currently supported, perhaps
it is supported by the GNU BFD library.  This can be used as a catch-all
solution to provide symbol reading support for the mpatrol library with object
file formats that are obscure or are just hard to implement readers for.  You'd
be surprised at how many object file formats are supported by that library and
if the new format is supported then try defining @code{FORMAT=FORMAT_BFD} for
the new system.

In all six of the above target macros, care should be taken not to define a new
macro that is effectively the same as an existing one, unless there are
significant differences.  For example, the dynamic linker used on BSD systems is
slightly different from the dynamic linker used on SunOS, but they both use
@code{DYNLINK=DYNLINK_BSD} because the underlying dynamic linker uses the same
data structures --- they are just named differently on the two systems.

Note that there are also corresponding @code{*_STR} macros for all six of the
above target macros.  These are used when displaying the target environment
information in the mpatrol log file so they should be as accurate as possible
so as to avoid misleading users.

Finally, you should determine if it is necessary to define any special macros
in order to obtain all of the required definitions from the system header files.
Many compilers default to providing an ANSI C or C++ environment without any
extensions, but as the mpatrol library uses additional features that are not
provided by these standards, it may be necessary to define additional macros
that allow the compiler to see the definitions of these features.  For example,
the @code{_POSIX_SOURCE} macro is defined here for all UNIX platforms so that
mpatrol can make use of the POSIX extensions.  Note that @file{src/target.h} is
the only mpatrol library source file that refers to the predefined preprocessor
macros defined by the system C compiler on a particular system (apart from a
few necessary exceptions) and the rest of the source code refers to the six
aforementioned macros for conditional compilation.

@item
Make any required changes in @file{src/memory.c} in order to support the new
system.

The mpatrol library, like the system malloc library it is replacing, must have
some way of allocating memory from the system heap for a process.  For UNIX
systems, this is done by calling @code{sbrk()} and/or @code{mmap()} but this is
likely to be completely different for other operating systems.  The mpatrol
library must also have some way of returning the allocated heap memory back to
the operating system, although on systems with virtual memory this is not really
an issue (see @code{MP_DELETEHEAP} in @file{src/config.h}).  If there is
currently no support in the mpatrol library for allocating and returning system
heap memory for the new system then you must modify @code{__mp_memalloc()} and
@code{__mp_memfree()} to add the support.  You should define
@code{MP_MMAP_SUPPORT} in @file{src/config.h} if the operating system is UNIX
and the system variant supports the @code{mmap()} system call.

Note that some (mainly embedded) systems may have no system heap available for a
program to use.  If that is the case then the mpatrol library can be built to
allocate memory from a static array whose size is fixed at compile-time.  The
@code{MP_ARRAY_SUPPORT} macro should be defined in @file{src/config.h} and the
@code{MP_ARRAY_SIZE} macro should be set to the maximum number of bytes that the
simulated heap should be able to hold.  Keep in mind that all of the internal
mpatrol library data structures will also be allocated from this array so it is
important to make it large enough.

Operating systems with virtual memory allow mpatrol to protect certain regions
of heap memory to ensure that they are not overwritten.  The
@code{MP_PROTECT_SUPPORT} macro in @file{src/config.h} controls whether the
operating system supports this, and the @code{__mp_memprotect()} and
@code{__mp_memquery()} functions should be updated to support the new system.
You should also define @code{MP_MINCORE_SUPPORT} in @file{src/config.h} if the
operating system is UNIX and the system variant supports the @code{mincore()}
system call.  The @code{MP_WATCH_SUPPORT} macro controls the support of software
watchpoints in a similar way and the @code{__mp_memwatch()} function should be
updated if they are supported.

If the new system is a UNIX system and it supports the @file{/proc} filesystem
then you may wish to define @code{MP_PROCFS_SUPPORT} in @file{src/config.h}.
However, this is only necessary if there is a way to detect the filename the
current process was invoked with (@code{MP_PROCFS_CMDNAME}) or a way to obtain
the filehandle of the executable file for the current process
(@code{MP_PROCFS_EXENAME}).  It may also be necessary if @code{MP_WATCH_SUPPORT}
is defined and the only way to set the watchpoints is via a file in the
@file{/proc} filesystem (@code{MP_PROCFS_CTLNAME}).

Finally, you should add support for determining the system page size in
@code{pagesize()} and the process identifier for the current process in
@code{__mp_processid()} if the system is not already supported@footnote{You will
also have to make any changes to @code{pagesize()} in @file{src/mpalloc.c} and
possibly also have to define @code{MP_MEMALIGN_SUPPORT} in @file{src/config.h}
if the new system supports the @code{memalign()} function.}.  You will also have
to add a way to determine the filename that the current process was invoked with
in @code{progname()}, otherwise the @option{PROGFILE} option will always have to
be used in order to read symbols from the executable file.  This can be done in
a multitude of ways, including examining global variables, making function calls
to query the system or traversing the call stack.

@item
Make any required changes in @file{src/stack.c} in order to support stack
traversal in the new processor architecture.

If the new processor architecture is CISC (complex instruction set computer)
then the chances are that you can easily find the frame pointer and return
address of the current stack frame by simply looking at a constant offset from
the parameter to the @code{__mp_getframe()} function.  The call chain can then
be obtained by following the frame pointer at each stage.  This can sometimes
be disrupted by optimisations that do not preserve the frame pointer but this
is usually confined to leaf routines and is not normally an issue.  The Intel
x86 and Motorola 680x0 processor families are good examples to look at when
implementing stack traversal for a CISC processor.

On the other hand, things might not be so easy if the new processor architecture
is RISC (reduced instruction set computer).  Such processors do not always have
fixed format stack frames@footnote{Although some do, and you can follow the
instructions for CISC processors above in order to provide stack traversal
support for them.} and so other means might have to be used.  The Alpha and MIPS
processor families are examples of these and code reading normally has to be
used in order to find the call instruction from the calling routine.  This then
has to be done for every function in the call stack.  An example of such code
can be found for the generic MIPS implementation.  Any assembler code that needs
to be written to support the stack traversal implementation should be written
in @file{src/machine.c}.

If the GNU compiler is being used then it might be possible to use its
@code{__builtin_frame_address()} and @code{__builtin_return_address()} builtin
functions in order to provide stack traversal.  These can only be used if they
return @samp{NULL} when the bottom of the call stack is reached, but on many
architectures the GNU compiler does not implement this correctly and so this
method of stack traversal cannot be used.  Even if it can, it still imposes an
upper limit on the size of the stack that can be traversed.  If this is not an
issue then it can be enabled with the @code{MP_BUILTINSTACK_SUPPORT} macro in
@file{src/config.h} and the maximum size of the call stack that can be traversed
can be set by changing the @code{MP_MAXSTACK} macro in the same file.  The
@code{MP_FULLSTACK} macro in @file{src/config.h} should be set for stack
traversal implementations that have no limit to the maximum size of the call
stack that can be traversed.  Obviously that is not the case for
@code{MP_BUILTINSTACK_SUPPORT}.  A similar method can be used to traverse the
stack using the @code{backtrace()} function from glibc with the
@code{MP_GLIBCBACKTRACE_SUPPORT} preprocessor macro.

Some operating systems have library functions that provide stack traversal
facilities and so you may wish to make use of them by defining
@code{MP_LIBRARYSTACK_SUPPORT} in @file{src/config.h} and implementing the code
to call them in @file{src/stack.c}.  Examples of systems that can make use of
this capability are IRIX and Tru64, although they have a drawback in that they
recursively call @code{malloc()} and so work slower than they normally would.
Alternatively, if libunwind has support for the processor architecture then you
can try defining @code{MP_LIBUNWIND_SUPPORT} in @file{src/config.h} to see if
that works.

If any functions from an external system library were used to help implement
stack traversal for the new processor architecture then you may also have to
modify the @code{MP_SYSTEM_LIBS} definitions in @file{src/config.h}, the
@code{__mp_lib*} definitions in @file{src/inter.c} and the @code{AC_CHECK_LIB()}
calls in @file{extra/mpatrol.m4}.

@item
Make any required changes in @file{src/symbol.c} in order to support any new
object file formats and dynamic linkers.

The best place to find information on the object file format and dynamic linker
interface supported by a new system is the on-line manual pages and header files
on that system.  If that fails then try the hardcopy technical reference manuals
that came with the system or the internet in order to find the information you
need.  There may also be standards that define the object file format and
dynamic linker interface across several systems.

If you defined a new @code{FORMAT} macro in @file{src/target.h} then you must
add the code to support it in @file{src/symbol.c}.  You will typically have to
add new @code{addsymbol()} and @code{addsymbols()} functions that are specific
to the new object file format and then add support for that format in
@code{__mp_addsymbols()} and @code{__mp_findsymbol()}.  If it is possible to
easily read a line number table from the object file format then you may also
want to extend the @code{__mp_findsource()} function to handle the new format as
well in order to support the @option{USEDEBUG} option.

If you defined a new @code{DYNLINK} macro in @file{src/target.h} then you must
also add the code to support it in @file{src/symbol.c}.  You will normally only
have to extend the @code{__mp_addextsymbols()} function to support the new
dynamic linker but there may be some extra work required to translate the base
addresses of any symbols read from shared libraries into real addresses.

In both cases, try to base the new code on the structure of the existing code
since it has been proven to work well and there is no point in reinventing the
wheel@footnote{You might also be interested to note that you can safely call
@code{malloc()} in this code to allocate memory --- just remember to clean up
after yourself!}.  You might decide to make changes to an existing
implementation instead; this was done with the COFF and XCOFF formats, for
example.

If any functions from an external object file access library were used to help
read symbols from the new object file format then you may also have to modify
the @code{MP_SYMBOL_LIBS} definitions in @file{src/config.h}, the
@code{__mp_lib*} definitions in @file{src/inter.c} and the @code{AC_CHECK_LIB()}
calls in @file{extra/mpatrol.m4}.

@item
Make any required changes in @file{src/signals.c} in order to obtain the address
of an illegal memory access in the new system.

If the system supports the @code{SA_SIGINFO} flag when setting up a signal
handler with @code{sigaction()} then it supports architecture-independent
determination of the address of an illegal memory access and the
@code{MP_SIGINFO_SUPPORT} macro should be set in @file{src/config.h}.

If this is not the case then an architecture-dependent method must be employed
in order to obtain this information.  On UNIX systems, signal handlers can have
additional arguments that may be used to probe for the address of a segmentation
violation or bus error.  On Windows systems, an exception record can be obtained
whenever an access violation occurs.  In either case, the saved register
containing the relevant address must be determined.  If this is not done then
the mpatrol library will compile correctly, but the addresses of illegal memory
accesses can never be determined.

@item
Make any required changes in @file{src/mutex.c} in order to support threads in
the new system.

The mpatrol library must be able to lock its data structures in a multithreaded
environment otherwise two threads may allocate memory at the same time and the
heap would become corrupted, for example.  On operating systems that have
virtual memory, processes have their own address space and can have more than
one thread of execution running at one time.  On other operating systems, there
is only one process (the operating system) and the threads are the user
processes that all share the same address space.  For that reason, you may wish
to use semaphores on such systems since they have no support for threads in a
conventional sense.

For systems that do support threads, mutexes should be used to lock the mpatrol
library data structures.  On UNIX platforms, POSIX threads are used but this
could easily be extended to other threads implementations.  On Windows
platforms, Win32 API threads are used.  For other systems, POSIX threads are
preferred but it should not be too hard to add support for others.  There should
also be a way to return the current thread identifier.

You should also determine if it is necessary to define any special macros
in order to obtain all of the required threadsafe definitions from the system
header files.  Many compilers require an option to be specified on the command
line in order to compile threadsafe code, but some still only require a
preprocessor macro to be defined during compilation.  For example, the
@code{_REENTRANT} macro is defined for Solaris systems so that mpatrol can make
use of the threadsafe definitions.  Any such macros should be defined in
@file{src/config.h} when @code{MP_THREADS_SUPPORT} is defined.

The multithreaded version of the mpatrol library must be initialised before a
process becomes multithreaded and so there must be a way to do this on a new
system.

The @code{MP_INIT_SUPPORT} macro should be defined in @file{src/config.h} if
the new system supports @samp{.init} and @samp{.fini} sections that get executed
before and after @code{main()} respectively.  Both the contents of the
@samp{.init} section (which should call @code{__mp_initmutexes()} and
@code{__mp_init()}) and the @samp{.fini} section (which should call
@code{__mp_fini()}) should be written in @file{src/machine.c} in assembler code.

There are also other methods to initialise and terminate the mpatrol library in
@file{src/inter.c} so you may need to use one of them (or add a new method of
your own) for the new system.  Note that if @code{MP_USE_ATEXIT} is defined in
@file{src/config.h} then these methods of terminating the mpatrol library when a
process ends are replaced by registering the @code{__mp_fini()} function with
@code{atexit()}.

There may be problems if the mpatrol library is built to override
@code{malloc()} and related functions if the system C library calls them before
the mpatrol library can be initialised.  There is a function in
@file{src/inter.c} on UNIX and Windows platforms called @code{crt_initialised()}
which checks to see if it is safe to initialise the mpatrol library, and if not
the relevant functions will use @code{sbrk()} to allocate the memory.  You may
have to modify @code{crt_initialised()} to support the new system if there are
initialisation problems.

If there are no special methods to initialise the multithreaded version of the
mpatrol library on a new system then it will simply be initialised at the first
call to one of its functions, hopefully before the process has become
multithreaded.

If there is support for reading symbols from object files on the new system
then you should compile and run the following test with the mpatrol library to
check to see if there is support for calling functions by their start address.
This is not always true on certain systems and will most likely result in the
test crashing if that is the case.  If the test works then the
@code{MP_INITFUNC_SUPPORT} macro should be set in @file{src/config.h}.

@smallexample
#include <stdio.h>
#include "mpatrol.h"


void __mp_init_test(void)
@{
    puts("__mp_init_* functions work");
@}


void __mp_fini_test(void)
@{
    puts("__mp_fini_* functions work");
@}


int main(void)
@{
    malloc(1);
    puts("there should be a line of output above and below");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
@}
@end smallexample

If any functions from an external threads library were used to lock the data
structures of the multithreaded version of the mpatrol library then you may also
have to modify the @code{MP_THREADS_LIBS} definitions in @file{src/config.h},
the @code{__mp_lib*} definitions in @file{src/inter.c} and the
@code{AC_CHECK_LIB()} calls in @file{extra/mpatrol.m4}.

@item
Make any required changes to @file{src/diag.c} in order to support the new
system.

If the directory separation characters used by filesystem pathnames on the new
system are different to those already supported then you must modify
@code{processfile()}, @code{__mp_logfile()}, @code{__mp_proffile()} and
@code{__mp_tracefile()} in order to support them.  The mpatrol library needs to
know how to extract and join the directory and filename components in a pathname
in order to support the special characters that may appear in the filenames
specified in the @option{LOGFILE}, @option{PROFFILE} and @option{TRACEFILE}
options.

@item
Make any required changes to @file{src/version.c} in order to support the new
system.

Different operating systems have different ways of embedding version information
into libraries.  For example, on AmigaOS the @command{version} command looks for
the @samp{$VER:} string in a binary file and displays any information following
it.  If the new system uses a special format for embedding version information
then an alternative definition for @code{__mp_version} should be added to
@file{src/version.c}.  It might also be useful to make any necessary changes to
the @command{mupdate} shell script in the @file{bin} directory in order to
support the new format, although that is not strictly required as it is only
used when building automated mpatrol releases.

The RCS revision string of each mpatrol source file can also be embedded into
the mpatrol library and its tools.  The way this is done is controlled by the
@code{MP_IDENT_SUPPORT} macro in @file{src/config.h}.  If it is set then the
system supports placing these strings in a special section in the object file
via the @code{#ident} directive, otherwise the strings will be placed in a data
section in the object file.

@item
Make any required changes in @file{src/mpatrol.c} in order to support executing
external commands.

The @command{mpatrol} command should be modified to support the execution of
external commands on a new operating system.  The @code{exec()} family of
functions are used on UNIX platforms, while the @code{spawn()} family of
functions are used on Windows platforms.  The ANSI C @code{system()} function is
currently used on all other platforms, but that runs the command indirectly
via the system command line interpreter (shell) which is not usually very
efficient.  You may also have to add the ability to find any commands using a
search path.

If the new operating system can support the @option{--dynamic} option of the
@command{mpatrol} command then the @code{MP_PRELOAD_SUPPORT} macro should be
defined in @file{src/config.h}.  The name of the environment variable that must
be used to specify the list of shared libraries to preload should be given in
@code{MP_PRELOAD_NAME} and the library separator string for the list should be
given in @code{MP_PRELOAD_SEP}.  The @code{MP_LIBNAME} macro may also need to
be modified if the naming convention of shared libraries is different on the
new system.  Note that the @code{__mp_editfile()} function in @file{src/diag.c}
may also need to be modified to prevent editor processes from being affected by
the @option{--dynamic} option.

@item
Make any required changes in @file{src/mptrace.c} in order to support any new
window systems.

The @command{mptrace} command may be built as a text-only command line tool, or
it may be built with GUI support if the @code{MP_GUI_SUPPORT} macro is defined
in @file{src/config.h}.  If it is built with GUI support and the @option{--gui}
option is specified then it becomes an event-driven tool and the code in
@file{src/mptrace.c} has been written to reflect that.  The @command{mptrace}
command currently only has Motif GUI support but if you wish to add support for
a new window system then it shouldn't be too hard to do.  Note that you will
probably have to add additional libraries to the @file{Makefile} when building
@command{mptrace} with @code{MP_GUI_SUPPORT} defined.

@item
Make any required changes to the shell scripts in the @file{bin} directory.

The @command{mpsym}, @command{mpedit} and @command{hexwords} commands all
require UNIX systems, or UNIX tools, to run.  If the new system has the ability
to run these commands then you should check that they run as expected.  If not,
you should make the necessary modifications to make them work, although it
should be in a generic fashion as there are no checks for specific platforms or
processors in these files.  You may also wish to add support for other debuggers
in @command{mpsym} and other editors in @command{mpedit}.

@item
Add a new subdirectory to the @file{build} directory if a new operating system
is being supported.

A new @file{Makefile} should be added in the new subdirectory along with any
extra system-specific files that might be needed to build the mpatrol library
on the new system.  The new @file{Makefile} should be based upon one of the
existing @file{Makefile}s in the other subdirectories but should obviously
differ in the platform-dependent areas.  You may wish to add more than one
@file{Makefile} to support different types of compilers on the new operating
system.

You must also decide which object files should get built into the mpatrol
library.  If it is not safe to override the system @code{malloc()} routines on
the new system then you should not include @file{src/malloc.c}, and the same
goes for @file{src/cplus.c} and the C++ operators.  If there is no @code{sbrk()}
function provided on the new operating system then you should include
@file{src/sbrk.c} if you need to call @code{sbrk()} in @file{src/inter.c}.

If the new operating system uses a special archive or package format then you
should add support for it by adding a new subdirectory to the @file{pkg}
directory.  A @file{build} script should be added to the new subdirectory that
will automatically build the archive or package file from scratch.  Include any
additional files that you need to perform the build in the new subdirectory as
well.

This section contains information about known bugs and limitations in the
mpatrol library as well as listing potential future enhancements.

Bugs should be reported to @email{graemeroy@@users.sourceforge.net} along with
the details of the operating system, processor architecture and object file
format that the mpatrol library is being used with --- and don't forget to
include the version of the mpatrol library you are using!  Nowadays I only
use Windows XP and Interix or Cygwin on Intel x86 computers, so I will be most
likely unable to reproduce most of the system-specific bugs on other platforms.
A bug report that comes with an associated fix will be most welcome.

Enhancement requests and source code containing enhancements should also be sent
to @email{graemeroy@@users.sourceforge.net} or the mpatrol discussion group at
@uref{http://groups.yahoo.com/group/mpatrol/}.  If you are planning to implement
an enhancement, let me know first in case I am (or someone else is) working
towards the same goal --- that way, work won't be wasted.  If you wish to send
me source code changes please send the changes as context diffs or in an e-mail
attachment as a compressed tar archive.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Overriding the C++ operators to get source-level information using the
preprocessor is still a bit dodgy and isn't likely to get much better, so
@code{MP_NONEWDELETE} may have to be used a lot.  Explicit references to
@code{operator new} rather than @code{new} are likely to result in compilation
errors, and the way that source level information is obtained for
@code{operator delete} means that the resulting code will not be thread-safe.
It might also be an idea to provide an allocation class from which user-defined
memory allocators can be derived.

@item
Need to add support for other 64-bit processors in addition to the existing
Alpha and SPARC V9 support.  This shouldn't be too hard, but I haven't got
access to such processors to test them, so I haven't been able to yet.  Also
need to add support for building on targets and architectures where no operating
system features are required or even available.

@item
Need to improve the concurrency in the thread-safe version of the mpatrol
library.  Currently, only one thread at a time is allowed to enter the mpatrol
library, but it should be possible to extend this to protect individual data
structures.  Note that this will not only help to improve efficiency, but might
also allow the mpatrol library to uncover bugs in thread-safe code that are
timing-dependent.

@item
Need to make the library re-entrant.  This could be achieved by moving the
static variables in @file{memory.c}, @file{stack.c}, @file{mutex.c},
@file{diag.c}, @file{trace.c}, @file{option.c} and @file{sbrk.c} into the
@code{infohead} structure and then having an array of @code{infohead} structures
from which to allocate new memory headers when a new one is required.  This is
only necessary for Amiga shared libraries and Netware NLMs since UNIX and
Windows platforms allocate a new copy of the data section in a shared library or
DLL when it is opened by a new process.

@item
Some implementations of call stack traversal are limited and will only likely
work for unoptimised code.  A much better solution would be write the
implementations at a lower level in assembly, but this is much less portable.
Perhaps there is a library which can be used to perform this across many
operating systems and processor architectures, or maybe someone would like to
write one@footnote{There is now a library called libunwind that mpatrol can be
built with to add support for stack traversal on various architectures and more
will likely follow in the future.  There is also a library called StackTrace
written by Bjorn Reese which invokes a debugger to generate a stack traceback
on certain UNIX platforms, although this method would be too slow for mpatrol
to use.}?  I can think of many applications that would benefit from such a
library besides this one.

@item
An alternative implementation for call stack traversal uses the functions
@code{__builtin_frame_address()} and @code{__builtin_return_address()} that are
available when the library is compiled with @command{gcc}.  However, they can
only traverse a number of stack frames at compile-time, not run-time so there is
a maximum number of stack frames that can be traversed at any one time.  The
implementation depends on both of these builtin functions returning @samp{NULL}
when the top of stack is reached.  If this is not the case then this method
cannot be used or should only be used with a small number of fixed stack frames.
However, using @code{backtrace()} from glibc is also supported as well.

@item
Is it worth adding functions to manually push and pop entries on the call stack
for platforms which have no support for call stack traversal?  This is currently
not a high-priority issue since almost all of the platforms that mpatrol is
available on have support for full call stack traversal.  However, it might be
handy anyway as an additional debugging tool for entering and leaving scopes.

@item
Need to change @code{__mp_compareaddrs()} so that it will improve the detection
of when to free memory allocations made by @code{alloca()} and its related
functions.  This will involve checking the common return addresses in the call
stacks instead of just checking them if the stack depth is the same.  Also,
on systems that don't have full call stack traversal, the minimum number of
bytes that stack frames should differ by should be platform-dependent since the
current value is way too high.

@item
Perhaps hash the call stacks when they are stored internally by the routines in
@file{addr.c}.  This would make for quick checks to see if two call stacks are
identical and it might save some memory in the process.

@item
There is an issue with callback functions if they call mpatrol library
functions, since this may lead to recursion in some obscure cases.  Callback
functions could also be defined for @code{__malloc_hook()},
@code{__realloc_hook()} and @code{__free_hook()} in much the same way as for the
GNU C library.

@item
Need to store filename and line number information in all call stacks so that
the information can be used at program termination.  May also need to display
this information in the @code{__mp_printinfo()} function and add this
information to the profiling output file so that @command{mprof} can make use of
it.

@item
In object file formats that support nested symbols (such as ELF), the current
implementation will tend to show some shortcomings.  This is because there is
currently no nesting count in the function that deals with symbol name lookup,
so the wrong symbol name may be displayed in diagnostics.

@item
In object file formats that don't store the sizes of symbols (such as basic
@file{a.out}, or when using the GNU BFD library), the current implementation
will simply assume that the current symbol terminates at the beginning of the
next symbol in the virtual address space.

@item
Perhaps add an option to prevent symbols from being read from object files.
This might be necessary if mpatrol is used in a program that loads shared
libraries explicitly, or if there is too much memory being used by mpatrol to
store the symbol details.

@item
Add functions to start and stop profiling, and perhaps also to clear the
profiling tables and begin a new profiling output file.  Should also write more
information to the profiling output file, such as the date that it was produced
on and the word size of the processor that it was produced on, so that
@command{mprof} will not crash when reading a profiling output file produced on
a processor that has a different word size.

@item
Perhaps add the ability to profile memory operations such as @code{memcpy()} and
@code{memset()} to the existing memory allocation profiling facility.  Also, add
options to @command{mprof} to write out files that can be used by chart drawing
software for a better visualisation of the first few profiling tables.

@item
Perhaps the allocation call graph table should have the capability to be sorted
in @command{mprof} and the @option{--leaks} option should work with it as well.
There should be better handling of cycles in the call graph and there is
currently a problem in that @command{mprof} cannot distinguish between call
sites with very low code addresses that have no symbols and that conflict with
existing symbol indices.

@item
Extend the @command{mptrace} command to graphically display the size of the heap
plotted against time and the allocation size frequency.  Also rewrite the GUI
support to use GNOME instead of Motif, possibly also using GLADE.

@item
Possibly add widgets to the @command{mptrace} window to pause and quit.  Might
also be handy to add the ability to write out charts summarising tracing
information.

@item
Handle marked memory allocations in the leak table, and also perhaps write out
to the mpatrol log file when an allocation is marked so that the @command{mleak}
command will work correctly.

@item
Improve the speed of watch points by setting a range of allocation indices for
which they will be used.  This may require a lot of code changes in
@file{alloc.c}.

@item
Add a software watch point facility that can be placed on ranges of addresses in
the heap.  Then, if a heap operation touches the watch point, either the user
can be notified or a callback function can be called.  The same could be done
for local variables if the stack frame can be easily determined, which would
also allow detecting if a read from or write to memory was performed just beyond
the stack pointer.

@item
Add a CRC checksum to memory blocks and use it to check that freed memory
allocations have not been corrupted when the @option{NOFREE} and
@option{PRESERVE} options are in use on platforms which have no memory
protection.

@item
Perhaps extend the @option{NOFREE} option to prevent the mpatrol library from
reusing freed memory allocations unless it really needs to.  This would mean
that no freed allocations would be reused until there is no more free memory
left and mpatrol would normally have to allocate more from the system.  It could
then convert as many freed allocations to free memory as it needs to fulfil the
allocation request, although it would probably still have to abide by the
minimum number of freed allocations set by the @option{NOFREE} option.

@item
Perhaps change the behaviour of the @option{NOFREE} option so that it doesn't
prevent in-place reallocations if there is enough memory to perform them.  Then
an option could be added to force reallocations to always allocate new memory
so that the behaviour could also be used when the @option{NOFREE} option is not
used.

@item
Add an option to set up a timer that will automatically check the heap after a
certain number of clock cycles have elapsed.  This could be useful in programs
that have long periods of time where no dynamic memory allocation functions are
called, but heap allocations are still manipulated.  In addition, checks could
automatically be made upon receipt of special signals sent to the program by
the user and information about the last successful verification of the heap
could be used to narrow down problems.  Perhaps even some statistics could be
printed on receipt of a special signal as well.

@item
Add a diagnostic number count to each warning and error reported in the log
file.  This could then be used to implement a @option{DIAGSTOP} option which
would stop the program running after a certain number of diagnostics have been
displayed.

@item
Add the ability to stop in a debugger when a memory allocation is made from a
particular file and line number, and perhaps also trap when a particular address
is allocated as part of a memory allocation.

@item
Perhaps add time information to the details stored about each memory allocation.
This is probably not useful unless the system provides a high-resolution timer.

@item
Add an option (perhaps @option{NOINTERNAL}) to suppress the display of internal
(recursive) memory allocations in the mpatrol log file and also prevent
information about such allocations being written to the profiling output and
tracing output files.  Perhaps this could be made the default so that they
behave in the same way as marked allocations, in which case we might want an
option which prevents internal and marked allocations being hidden.  This could
also be extended to prevent memory leaks from being reported if the original
allocations were made from a given set of functions.

@item
Add a function to add a block of memory to the heap, possibly a memory-mapped
file.  Also add a function that can shrink the heap if large areas of free
memory exist.

@item
Maybe show the contents of the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable in the
summary as well.

@item
Add versions of @code{mallopt()}, @code{mallinfo()}, @code{memorymap()},
@code{mallocctl()}, @code{mallocblksize()} and @code{msize()} which are provided
in many other malloc libraries.  These won't necessarily behave in exactly the
same way as existing implementations, but at least there won't be link errors
when compiling source code which uses them.  Also, add support for setting as
many remaining options in @code{__mp_setoption()} as possible and perhaps even
some options before the mpatrol library has been initialised.

@item
Add similar functions to the GNU @code{mcheck()} and @code{mprobe()} functions.
Perhaps also add an mpatrol tool to add compatibility with the GNU memusage
tool.

@item
Perhaps add debugging/tracing versions of the string manipulation functions,
such as @code{strlen()} and @code{strcmp()} in much the same way as was done for
the memory operation functions.  The only problem with this would be locale
support, but perhaps it might be easier just to assume the C locale to begin
with.  Also need to have better detection of internal and free blocks when
displaying memory range errors.

@item
Add wide-character equivalents of @code{memset()}, etc.  These are defined as
@code{wmemset()}, etc.@: and are now part of ANSI C.  Also add @code{wcsdup()},
@code{memdup()} and @code{xmemdup()} as well as @code{mempcpy()} and
@code{memrchr()}.

@item
Perhaps reimplement the standard I/O library for internal use by mpatrol, thus
preventing recursive calls to @code{malloc()} each time a write to the log file
occurs on some systems.  Example code to do this was submitted by Alexander
Barton and this may well be incorporated into the library at some point in the
future@footnote{This code can be applied as an mpatrol library patch which can
be downloaded from
@uref{http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mpatrol/mpatrol_patch1.tar.gz}.}.

@item
Add the ability to use the reporting and tracing infrastructure of mpatrol
with the existing C library's memory allocation implementation.

@item
The @option{LOG*} options could be extended to take a list of specific functions
to log.  They could also only log operations spanning a range of addresses or
allocation indices as well.

@item
Add an option to limit the size of each memory allocation to a maximum number
of bytes.  This could be useful if a memory allocation function is called with
an uninitialised variable.

@item
Add assertion macros to @file{mpatrol.h} that can be used in program code.
These could be used to assert that pointers have not been freed, are valid
heap addresses or are strings, or perhaps even that the address is readable,
writable and/or executable.  They would be disabled if @code{NDEBUG} is defined.

@item
Add support functions that could be added to user code to enter and leave
scopes in a source file and ensure that all allocations allocated within the
scope are freed by the time the scope has been exited.

@item
Add support for the @option{-finstrument-functions} option of the GNU compiler.
This would allow mpatrol to keep track of the entry to and exit from every
function, but would only work for code compiled with this option.

@item
Extend the Checker-support functions to store and check information about
access permissions within heap memory and perhaps also in the stack as well,
and also improve the diagnostics from the checker functions if they fail.
Currently, the Checker-support functions only ensure that no memory accesses
cross allocation boundaries or access free memory.  Could also make use of the
@code{etext}, @code{edata} and @code{end} pointers that are set at run-time on
most UNIX systems.  Need to properly implement @code{chkr_check_exec()}.

@item
Details of the segments which make up the executable file and any shared
libraries could be made use of in order to detect operations which cross such
segments.  For example, a memory operation may erroneously cross the data
and BSS segments.  The symbol table for data symbols could also be used to
provide much finer-grained error-checking.  Need to make use of the
@code{__mp_memquery()} function.

@item
Add garbage detection support to mpatrol.  This would be implemented as a
function that would traverse all of the roots of the memory in a process and
look for pointers into free memory or the lack of any pointers into allocated
memory (to detect memory leaks).

@item
Add an option to specify that all failed memory allocations should abort (or at
least give a warning) instead of returning a @samp{NULL} pointer.  Also, perhaps
add an option to display the partial contents of freed and unfreed allocations
in the mpatrol log file.

@item
Perhaps add memory protection to the simulated @code{sbrk} heap.

@item
Add an option to force the mpatrol library to return @samp{NULL} if it is
asked to allocate a zero-sized block of memory.  This might be useful for SVID
compliant programs.  Perhaps also extend the mpatrol library to allow
zero-sized blocks.  I suspect the easiest way to do this is to have a special
address that is always returned for such blocks and that will have the
appropriate size of overflow buffers depending on the options used.

@item
Add an option to report if one thread resizes or frees another thread's
allocations.  This may not be useful in most cases, but it might be possible
to track down some obscure bugs in some situations.

@item
Perhaps add internationalisation support through the use of locales and message
catalogs.  Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a unified method for doing
this across all platforms and there may also be issues with third-party
libraries calling @code{malloc()} and other related routines when the mpatrol
library is attempting to initialise itself.

@item
There is currently a problem when the mpatrol library encounters an illegal
memory access on UNIX and Windows platforms, and there is a further illegal
memory access when it is displaying the summary.  This should be prevented by
disabling the signal handler at its first entry.

@item
Need to make the mpalloc library threadsafe@footnote{And perhaps also make the
mptools library threadsafe as well}.  This is only likely to be an issue when
calling @code{MP_FAILURE()}.  Should also add something similar to
@code{xmalloc_set_program_name()} in order to show the program name when a
memory allocation fails.  If the C++ operators fail to allocate memory in
libmpalloc then there should probably also be an exception thrown to mimic the
behaviour of libmpatrol, although this isn't a big issue since the program
should be completely recompiled to remove mpatrol debugging before a release.
In the same vein, perhaps there should be some sort of support for
@code{set_new_handler()} in libmpalloc.

@item
Add an option to write the mpatrol log file in HTML format, or even better XML
format.  Need to also extend what is written out by the @option{--hatf-file}
option.

@item
The @command{mpsym} command could optionally preserve any stack traceback lines
that already have symbolic or debugging information associated with them.  It
could also support more debuggers other than just @command{gdb}.  Finally, it
could support @file{-} as the filename for reading the mpatrol log file from the
standard input file stream.

@item
A good idea might be to have the @command{mpatrol} command read options from a
configuration file instead of an environment variable, but that will only work
if it doesn't involve allocating any memory before the mpatrol library has been
initialised.

@item
Perhaps incorporate a C++ encoded name demangler into the mpatrol library.  The
most likely candidate is the GNU demangler that comes with the libiberty
library, but that currently allocates temporary space on the heap using
@code{xmalloc()} which means that it will run unbearably slowly under
mpatrol@footnote{If you really really want this functionality then code to do
this is available as an mpatrol library patch which can be downloaded from
@uref{http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mpatrol/mpatrol_patch4.tar.gz}.}.

@item
Add a script to wrap around various popular C and C++ compiler drivers so that
linking with the mpatrol library is much less laborious.  In addition, a
user-defined command or script file could be executed at the end of every
invocation of the @command{mpatrol} command.

@item
Add a script to automatically run the mpatrol library tests.  It could be quite
hard to verify the tests since the heap addresses are likely to be different on
every new build and will certainly be different across different platforms.

@item
Improve the autoconf, automake and libtool support.  Also update the
@command{mupdate} shell script to automatically update the version numbers
contained in the files in the @file{pkg} directory.

@item
The postscript version of the quick reference card seems to print at an unusual
offset on some printers.

@item
Perhaps add benchmark tests for dynamic memory allocation functions and memory
operation functions.  Obviously the mpatrol library would perform much worse
than normal malloc libraries, but it would help to see just how much worse so
that speed improvements could be made.

@item
Add support for the BeOS operating system, as well as MacOS, NeXT and OS/2.
Perhaps MS-DOS might be possible as well.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Need to improve watch point facility in order to speed it up by an order of
magnitudes.  This will most likely involve removing all watch points when
entering the library and replacing them when returning to user code.

@item
Improve use of watch points by allowing an option which will only install write
watch points instead of both read and write watch points.  Not only will this
speed up the use of watch points, but will also cause less problems with reading
from misaligned memory allocations.

@item
There seems to be a problem on some UNIX systems in that the @code{mprotect()}
call will not work unless it is used on memory that has been allocated with
@code{mmap()}.  This needs to be investigated further.

@item
Install a signal handler that can be sent a non-terminating signal that would
instruct the mpatrol library to log a list of memory leaks and possibly write
a profile output file.  This would be useful for monitoring daemon processes.

@item
There is currently a problem in that the call stack displayed from within the
illegal memory access signal handler is not necessarily accurate with respect to
the function at the top of the stack.  In addition, signal handlers shouldn't
technically call I/O functions in case of additional signals being caught so
this may need to be improved.

@item
Need to add a way of initialising the thread-safe version of the library when
it is not compiled on a system that supports @samp{.init} sections, or if it is
not compiled with the GNU C compiler, or if it is not compiled with a C++
compiler.  Also perhaps need to support other threads packages instead of just
POSIX threads.

@item
Need to add support for call stack traversal for the Itanium processor
architecture.  The current implementation of call stack traversal for the
Motorola 88xx0 family is also a bit flaky and so should only be used when the
library and program are built unoptimised.  This could be improved on DG/UX
platforms by making use of the TDESC information stored in the object files.

@item
Need to add support for obtaining the program name from the stack for the Alpha,
Itanium and Motorola 88xx0 processor architectures.  If there is no support for
determining the filename that a program was invoked with then the
@option{PROGFILE} option can be used to specify the program name at run-time.

@item
If the @code{MP_LIBRARYSTACK_SUPPORT} preprocessor macro is defined when
building the mpatrol library on IRIX platforms then the @file{libexc} library
must also be linked in.  However, execution speed will fall dramatically since
the @code{unwind()} function within that library calls @code{malloc()},
@code{free()} and other memory operation functions every time it is invoked.
The only reason to use this library rather than the default method of stack
traversal on MIPS would be if that method failed due to a bug (in which case
it should be reported anyway).

@item
The mpatrol library @code{unwind()} function on MIPS platforms may have problems
with call stack traversal in alternative stacks, such as those used by signal
handlers.  The call stack will then terminate at the point at which the handler
was called rather than unwinding to the top of the stack.

@item
The library cannot currently read any symbols from shared objects that have been
read via @code{dlopen()}, @code{shl_load()} or similar functions@footnote{There
is an mpatrol library patch that supports reading symbols from shared libraries
opened by @code{dlopen()} which can be downloaded from
@uref{http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mpatrol/mpatrol_patch2.tar.gz}.}.
In addition, symbols cannot currently be read from any COFF or XCOFF shared
libraries on LynxOS and some work needs to be done to build the mpatrol library
as a shared library on LynxOS.

@item
Perhaps add support for reading HP/UX executable files and libraries in the SOM
object file format without needing to use the GNU BFD library.

@item
Perhaps add support for other popular text editors in the @command{mpedit}
command.  Also add a way to specify editor options to the @command{mpedit}
command.

@item
Add support for SCO UNIX, Ultrix and other non-System V UNIX operating systems.
Also test on NetBSD, OpenBSD and SunOS as support has been written for these
systems but is untested.  The SunOS port requires an ANSI C compiler, though.

@item
The @option{--dynamic} option to the @command{mpatrol} command does not always
work on systems whose dynamic linkers support the @env{LD_PRELOAD} or
@env{_RLD_LIST} environment variables.  This is because the object file format
access libraries do not exist in shared form on such systems.

@item
Perhaps add files to build the mpatrol library and tools as BSD packages.

@cindex Amiga notes

The Amiga has now been re-released as a completely new machine which comes with
a completely new operating system.  As a result, I will not be implementing
any of the following features (or fixing any of the following problems) in
mpatrol for the old AmigaOS.  Support for the new AmigaOS may be added in the
future.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Perhaps add support for building mpatrol as an Amiga shared library.  I
attempted to do this in a previous release of mpatrol, but it would have
involved too many source changes to get working fully.  Perhaps it's not even
worth implementing as the archive library works fine.  However, if it is built
as a shared library and @code{malloc()} and related functions are dynamically
linked in some executable files then perhaps it would be possible to override
these functions, thus getting the @option{--dynamic} option in the
@command{mpatrol} command to work.

@item
Need to fix the problem where the maximum guaranteed alignment of an internal
mpatrol library memory allocation is 8 bytes.  However, this limitation does
not affect the @code{memalign()} and related functions, and should not have any
effect on the running of mpatrol since no datatypes require an alignment of more
than 8 bytes.

@item
Need to add proper support for call stack traversal for both the Motorola 680x0
and PowerPC processor architectures.  When @command{gcc} is being used then
up to two stack frames can be traversed, but this should really be extended
without requiring @code{MP_BUILTINSTACK_SUPPORT}.  When SAS/C is being used then
there is no support for call stack traversal.

@item
Need to add proper support for reading symbols from Amiga executable files.
When @command{gcc} is being used then the BFD library routines will be called
to determine the symbols from the executable file, but this will only work for
objects compiled with @command{gcc} and there currently appears to be a problem
getting the @option{USEDEBUG} option to work.  When SAS/C is being used then
there is no support for reading symbols from executable files.  Also need to add
support for reading symbols from any shared libraries that are required by the
program.

@item
Possibly make use of other software such as Enforcer, Mungwall or MuLib in order
to provide some form of memory protection.  The features of SegTracker could
also be put to good use so that the file and hunk location of entries on the
call stack could be determined.

@item
Could add support for the @option{EDIT} and @option{LIST} options.  This would
probably involve finding a way to invoke a shell script without having to search
for the script file or allocating memory in the process.

@item
Add GUI support for the @command{mptrace} command.

@item
When using SAS/C it is currently not possible to override the definition of
@code{malloc()}, etc.@:, without including the @file{mpatrol.h} header file
first.  This is because the compiler startup code and libraries call
@code{malloc()} before everything is set up, and so the library cannot properly
initialise itself if the @code{malloc()} that the startup code finds is the
@code{malloc()} in the mpatrol library.  This restriction does not exist when
using @command{gcc}.

@item
Add support for the Amiga in the threads test in @file{tests/pass/test5.c}.
The Amiga doesn't really have support for threads but its processes are similar
enough to threads.

@item
Perhaps add an @command{Installer} installation script with icons.

@item
Need to add support for processors other than the Intel 80x86.  However, about
99% of Windows platforms run on this processor family --- does anyone really use
Windows with other processors?  Also finish MinGW support for building with the
GNU C compiler but using the Microsoft C library, and also Cygwin support,
although this is effectively mpatrol built with @option{-DTARGET=TARGET_UNIX}
on Windows platforms.

@item
Perhaps add support for compiling the mpatrol library with @command{gcc} on
Windows platforms so that the GNU BFD library can be used as well.

@item
There seems to be a problem when mixing the archive version of the mpatrol
library and the Microsoft C run-time library DLL, and vice versa.  This needs
to be looked into, but for the moment, don't mix them.

@item
The library cannot currently read any symbols from DLLs that have been read via
@code{LoadLibrary()}.

@item
There seems to be a disparity between different versions of the imagehlp
library.  It would appear that the latest incarnation of the imagehlp library
has had some functions removed and placed in a new library called debughlp.
Perhaps this simply means that @file{debughlp.lib} needs to be linked in as
well, but maybe there's more to it than that.

@item
Perhaps add support for the @command{mpatrol} command's @option{--dynamic}
option by preloading the mpatrol DLL from the @command{mpatrol} command.

@item
Could add support for the @option{EDIT} and @option{LIST} options.  This would
probably involve finding a way to invoke a batch file without having to search
for the batch file or allocating memory in the process.

@item

There doesn't appear to have been any interest in the Netware version of mpatrol
and as a result I will not be implementing any of the following features (or
fixing any of the following problems) in mpatrol for Netware.  I don't even have
access to a Netware machine so someone else would have had to have done it
anyway.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The library has not yet been built (let alone tested) on Netware platforms.  The
names of the system functions that the library calls for Netware were obtained
by looking at Novell's developer documentation, so they may not even compile
correctly without modification.

@item
Need to add support for building the mpatrol library as an NLM@.  This is not
currently a high priority requirement as the archive library should suffice for
most purposes.  However, if it is built as an NLM and @code{malloc()} and
related functions are dynamically linked in some executable files then perhaps
it would be possible to override these functions, thus getting the
@option{--dynamic} option in the @command{mpatrol} command to work.

@item
Need to add support for processors other than the Intel 80x86.  However, about
99% of Netware platforms run on this processor family --- does anyone really use
Netware with other processors?

@item
Need to add way to determine when the base of the stack has been reached during
call stack traversal, since on Netware every application is really a thread
running under one large process.

@item
Need to add support for reading symbols from Netware load modules.  Also need to
add support for reading symbols from any NLMs that are required by the program.
This may be possible in a limited fashion by using the GNU BFD library, but may
only work with code compiled with @command{gcc}.

@item
Could add support for the @option{EDIT} and @option{LIST} options.  This would
probably involve finding a way to invoke a batch file without having to search
for the batch file or allocating memory in the process.

@item
Add GUI support for the @command{mptrace} command.

@item
Need to investigate if it is safe (or even possible) to override the definitions
of @code{malloc()}, etc.@:, without including the @file{mpatrol.h} header file
first.  Currently, non-macro definitions for these functions have been disabled
in the Netware version of the library in case they affect other NLMs that are
currently running.

@enumerate 1
@cindex documentation formats
@item
I can't seem to format the @TeX{}info manual for mpatrol into anything that I
can view or print.  What am I doing wrong?

You'll need to have the appropriate document formatting programs installed on
your system before you can do this, and even then you'll also need to have
suitable software for viewing or printing the formatted documents.  The mpatrol
distribution should already contain the latest mpatrol manual in a variety of
formats and should also contain a file telling you where to get programs that
can be used to view or print these files.  Alternatively, you can browse the
latest mpatrol manual on-line at
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpatrol/}.

@item
I'd like to convert the mpatrol manual to a different documentation format but
there is no support for that format in the @file{Makefile}.  How would I go
about doing this?

Since @TeX{}info is intended to be converted to other documentation formats it
should be fairly easy for you to find a tool which will convert it into your
desired format.  Please note that I probably won't provide preformatted
versions of the mpatrol manual in any other format which isn't already
supported.

@cindex DVI
@cindex postscript
@item
Why is the reference card not centred in the middle of the page when I print it?

The reference card has three columns in landscape format and as a result
requires smaller margins than La@TeX{} normally uses.  When @command{dvips}
converts the DVI file to a postscript file it refers to a configuration file set
up for a specific printer so that it knows what that printer's capabilities are.
However, you can instruct @command{dvips} to offset the page by a given amount
with the @option{-O} option so that it appears centred when printed.  I find
that @option{-O -0.75in,0.25in} works for me.  Note that the default paper size
for the reference card is DIN A4, but you can change it to US letter in the
La@TeX{} source file.

@cindex INFOPATH
@item
How do I install the mpatrol manual as a GNU info file?

Assuming you have the GNU info file built and copied to your system's info file
directory, you should use the @command{install-info} command to place an entry
for mpatrol in your system's GNU info directory file, otherwise the GNU info
reader may not be able to locate the mpatrol entry.  You may also need to modify
your @env{INFOPATH} environment variable if you installed the GNU info file in a
non-standard place.

@cindex MANPATH
@item
How do I install the mpatrol manual pages?

This is very system-dependent, but need only be done on UNIX systems since they
cannot be used on other platforms.  The unformatted manual pages exist in
@file{man/man1} and @file{man/man3} and should be copied to your system's manual
page directory.  If you don't have the @command{nroff}, @command{troff} or
@command{groff} commands installed on your system then you may also need to copy
the formatted manual pages, located in @file{man/cat1} and @file{man/cat3}.  You
may also need to modify your @env{MANPATH} environment variable if you installed
the manual pages in a non-standard place, and some systems require you to update
the @emph{whatis} database after installing new manual pages, by running
@command{makewhatis}, @command{catman} or equivalent.

Alternatively, the mpatrol manual pages can be built in a variety of different
documentation formats that can be viewed or printed without the need for a
@command{man} command.  If you have the correct tools installed on your system
then you should be able to do this by examining the @file{Makefile} in the
@file{man} directory.  The mpatrol distribution should already contain the
latest mpatrol manual pages in a variety of formats and should also contain a
file telling you where to get programs that can be used to view or print these
files.

@cindex MANROFFSEQ
@item
Why does the @file{libmpatrol.3} manual page not display correctly when I view
it with the @command{man} command?

This is likely to be due to the @command{tbl} command not being run to process
the tables when the @command{man} command displays the manual page.  Many UNIX
systems look at the first line of the manual page to see what filters to run the
page through before it is displayed, but some systems do not recognise this and
instead rely on an environment variable such as @env{MANROFFSEQ} to specify
which filters are to be run.  Look at the manual page for the @command{man}
command on your system to find out more information.

@item
Why does the @file{Makefile} assume that I am building mpatrol on platform X
when I am really building on platform Y?

The @file{src/config.h} and @file{src/target.h} header files attempt to obtain
as much information from the compiler as possible, mainly from any predefined
preprocessor macros that it defines during compilation.  If this information
is incorrect then you can override the @code{TARGET}, @code{SYSTEM},
@code{ARCH}, @code{ENVIRON}, @code{FORMAT} and @code{DYNLINK} preprocessor
macros defined in @file{src/target.h} to suit your particular system by
explicitly defining them in @code{CFLAGS} within the @file{Makefile} when you
build mpatrol.  You could also choose to build different versions of mpatrol
with different settings of @code{ENVIRON}, @code{FORMAT} or @code{DYNLINK} on a
single system if you wish to by changing @code{ENVIRON}, @code{FORMAT} or
@code{DYNLINK} for different builds.

@cindex 32-bit
@cindex 64-bit
@item
The processor family I am compiling on supports both 32-bit and 64-bit modes
of operation.  How do I specify which I want?

You will have to look at the documentation for the compiler you are using in
order to find out how to specify which operating environment you wish to
target.  For example, if you are using the Sun C compiler on a SPARC V9 Solaris
machine then you should specify the @option{-xarch=v9} option in the
@file{Makefile} when you are building mpatrol in order to target the 64-bit
environment.  If you think that you are already using the correct option, but
the mpatrol code is still being built to support the wrong environment then you
could try explicitly setting the @code{ENVIRON} preprocessor macro in the
@file{Makefile}.

@item
I cannot include @file{mpatrol.h} from my C++ source code as I get lots of
compilation errors.  Why is this and what can I do to prevent them?

The most likely reason that you are getting errors is because you are calling
placement @code{new}, and the way that mpatrol derives source information from
calls to @code{operator new} is by defining a macro called @code{new}, thus
causing lots of problems when calling placement @code{new} or explicitly
calling @code{operator new}.  You can either try not to use placement
@code{new} or you can define the preprocessor macro @code{MP_NOCPLUSPLUS} when
compiling your source file, which will disable the overriding of any C++
operators in @file{mpatrol.h}.  Alternatively, if you define
@code{MP_NONEWDELETE} then you can use @code{MP_NEW}, @code{MP_NEW_NOTHROW} and
@code{MP_DELETE} in order to call the mpatrol versions of the C++ operators.

@item
I still have the above problem, but I don't think it's due to placement
@code{new} since the compiler complains about @code{operator new[]}, so could
that be a clue?

Yes.  The most likely reason is that the C++ compiler does not support the array
@code{new} and @code{delete} operators.  These were introduced some time before
the standardisation of the C++ language but some compilers may not yet have
support for them.  It may be that you have to use a special compiler option to
enable support for these operators, but if not you will probably have to edit
@file{mpatrol.h} to temporarily allow your files to compile.

@item
I tried both of the above suggestions, but I still can't get my C++ source code
to compile.  I'm using an old C++ compiler so could that be a problem?

Yes.  The @file{mpatrol.h} header file defines new versions of the C++ dynamic
memory allocation operators using exceptions and namespaces as required by the
ANSI C++ standard.  If your C++ compiler has no support for these then you
should compile your C++ source files with @code{MP_NOCPLUSPLUS} defined.  You
may also be using an older C++ library in which the @file{new} header file does
not define @code{set_new_handler()} to be in the @code{std} namespace.  You will
then have to change the @file{mpatrol.h} header file and @file{cplus.c} source
file accordingly.

@item
I'm calling @code{operator new} (not the @emph{nothrow} version) from my C++
source code but when my program runs out of memory the @samp{OUTMEM} error is
given in the mpatrol log file rather than throwing a @code{std::bad_alloc}
exception.  Why is this?

Sounds like the mpatrol library was built with a C compiler.  In order for the
mpatrol versions of @code{operator new} and @code{operator new[]} to throw an
exception when they run out of memory, the mpatrol library must have been built
with a C++ compiler.  The @samp{OUTMEM} error is only given when there is no way
to throw an exception.

@item
Why am I unable to call the mpatrol version of @code{alloca()}?  I only ever
seem to call the default version.

Most implementations of the @code{alloca()} function are compiler builtins which
will be converted to inline assembler or object code in order for them to be
able to dynamically modify the calling function's stack frame at run-time.  As
a result, the call to @code{alloca()} is recognised as an intrinsic keyword and
is dealt with specially by the compiler.  However, if this can be intercepted by
the preprocessor before the compiler parses the source code then the call can be
redirected to another function.  This is one of the functions of the
@file{mpatrol.h} header file, which means that it must be included before the
first call the @code{alloca()}.  If @code{alloca.h} is also being included then
@code{mpatrol.h} must be included after it, otherwise it may redefine
@code{alloca()} back to the default version.

@cindex inline functions
@item
Why do some of the @file{Makefile}s contain the @option{-fno-inline-functions}
option as part of @code{OFLAGS}?

The @option{-fno-inline-functions} option is a @command{gcc}-specific option
which instructs the compiler not to inline any functions.  This is necessary on
some platforms where function call stack traversal is supported, since function
inlining may significantly alter the layout of a program's stack.  Normally this
option is only required when building the mpatrol library, but on some platforms
function call stack traversal may not work properly unless this option (or
equivalent) is used for all compiled code.

@cindex MP_ALIGN
@item
What does the @code{MP_ALIGN} definition in @file{mpatrol.h} do?

It is a preprocessor macro function that is used to return the minimum alignment
in bytes required for a specified type at compile-time.  It is used in the
@code{MP_MALLOC} family of functions to specify the required alignment of the
memory allocation that is to be used to store the specified type.  Some
compilers provide a built-in function that can be used to determine the minimum
alignment of a type at compile-time.  For all others, this macro makes use of
some structure trickery in combination with the @code{offsetof} macro.

@cindex MP_INLINE
@cindex extern inline
@cindex static inline
@item
What does the @code{MP_INLINE} definition in @file{mpatrol.h} do?

It is used in the definition of the debugging versions of the C++ operators in
@file{mpatrol.h} so that they are inlined correctly.  We want to define the C++
operators so that they will be inlined in every source file that uses them and
also not clash with the versions defined in the mpatrol library or the standard
C++ library.  Traditionally, this is done by defining them to be
@code{static inline}, which means that any non-inlined definition will be local
to each object file.  An even better technique is available with the new C++
standard which allows @code{extern inline} definitions, meaning that no
definition will be available if the function is not inlined.  Unfortunately, if
optimisation is turned off in the compiler then no inlining will usually be
performed and so the definitions will be real functions.  Luckily, on ELF
platforms the @code{extern inline} function definition will have a weak
visibility and so will not clash with library functions.

@item
Why do I get different stack traces in the mpatrol log file from the C++
operators in @file{mpatrol.h} when optimisation is turned on and off in the
compiler?

When the compiler is optimising it will invariably be performing inlining, in
which case each inlined function will share the stack frame of its caller when
it is called --- the mpatrol library cannot detect this.  In order to cope in
both situations, the non-inlined case will contain the name of the C++ operator
at the top of its stack, even though it will be removed in the inlined case.

@cindex Motif
@cindex LessTif
@item
How do I build the @command{mptrace} command with GUI support?

The GUI support for the @command{mptrace} command is currently written to use
Motif and X Windows and so can only be built on systems with these libraries
and run on systems with an X server.  This will most likely be possible only on
UNIX platforms.  LessTif can be used instead of Motif if that is all that is
available on your system.  The UNIX @file{Makefile} has a macro called
@code{GUISUP} which can be set to @code{true} or @code{false} depending on
whether you wish to have GUI support or not.  The default is @code{false}.
GUI support is automatically enabled on platforms that support it if the
@file{configure} script in @file{pkg/auto} is used.

@cindex MP_GUI_SUPPORT
@item
How do I build the @command{mptrace} command without GUI support?

This is done by default on most platforms when using the @file{Makefile}s in
the @file{build} directory.  However, if for some reason that is not the case
then on UNIX platforms you will have to set the @code{GUISUP} @file{Makefile}
macro to @code{false} when compiling @command{mptrace}.  You might need to do
this if your UNIX system does not have the correct header files and libraries
installed needed for GUI support.  If you are using the @file{configure} script
in @file{pkg/auto} then GUI support will be automatically disabled on platforms
that do not support it, but you can force it to be disabled by using the
@option{--without-x} option.

@cindex undefined symbols
@item
Why do I get undefined symbols when linking with the mpatrol library?

This is most likely caused by the mpatrol library requiring additional symbols
defined in an object file access library.  If mpatrol was built with
@code{FORMAT=FORMAT_COFF} or @code{FORMAT=FORMAT_XCOFF} then you'll need to add
@option{-lld} (or equivalent) to the compiler command line straight after
@option{-lmpatrol}.  If mpatrol was built with @code{FORMAT=FORMAT_ELF32} or
@code{FORMAT=FORMAT_ELF64} then you'll need to add @option{-lelf} (or
equivalent) to the compiler command line straight after @option{-lmpatrol}.  If
mpatrol was built with @code{FORMAT=FORMAT_BFD} then you'll need to add
@option{-lbfd -liberty -lintl} (or equivalent) instead.  If you are using the
thread-safe version of mpatrol then you may also need to link with the system
threads library.

@item
Why do I still get undefined symbols on HP/UX, IRIX, Tru64 or Windows platforms,
despite following the above instructions?

If the symbol is called @code{U_get_previous_frame} on HP/UX then you still need
to link with the system stack traceback library, @file{libcl.sl}.  If the
symbols are called @code{exc_setjmp} and @code{unwind} on IRIX or Tru64 and you
defined the @code{MP_LIBRARYSTACK_SUPPORT} preprocessor macro when building the
mpatrol library then you still need to link with the system exception library,
@file{libexc.so}.  If the symbols all begin with @code{Sym} on Windows platforms
then you still need to link with the system symbol access library,
@file{imagehlp.lib}.

@item
I tried all of the above, but why is the @code{SymGetLineFromAddr} symbol still
undefined on Windows platforms?

This is due to the @file{imagehlp.lib} or @file{imagehlp.dll} libraries on your
system being out of date.  The @code{SymGetLineFromAddr()} function was added to
this library at a much later date from the original release so if you want the
@code{USEDEBUG} option to work you should try to get an updated library from
Microsoft.  Alternatively, you can disable the call to it in
@code{__mp_findsource()} but the @option{USEDEBUG} option will no longer work.

@cindex Windows symbols setup
@item
Why is the mpatrol library unable to read any symbols from DLLs despite the fact
that my program uses them?

Windows executable files and DLLs only contain a list of symbol names which are
imported and exported but do not contain details of such symbols at the same
level as object files.  To do this requires the symbolic information to be
retained by the linker, but this has not been done for the system DLLs.  The
mpatrol library uses the imagehlp system library to read symbols from DLLs but
this will only work if the required system debugging symbols are installed on
your machine.  In Visual C++, this can be done by selecting the @samp{Windows
NT Symbols Setup} start menu item.

@cindex duplicate symbols
@item
Why do I get duplicate definitions of symbols when linking with the mpatrol
library?

This is most likely caused by your code, or a library, providing definitions of
@code{malloc()} and @code{free()} which conflict with those defined in the
mpatrol library.  You'll need to disable these in order to perform a successful
link and use the replacements in mpatrol instead.

@item
Why do I get @code{xmalloc()} as a multiply-defined symbol when I link with the
archive version of the mpatrol library?

If the mpatrol library was built with @code{FORMAT=FORMAT_BFD} then it is
because the libiberty library contains definitions of the @code{xmalloc()}
family of functions as well.  You should rebuild the mpatrol library without
the definitions of the relevant @code{xmalloc()} functions in @file{malloc.c}.
You're also likely to get this error if you link with the archive version of
the mpatrol library and one or more of the @code{xmalloc()} family of functions
is defined in another archive library that you are linking with.

@cindex PATH
@item
I linked my program to a shared library version of mpatrol.  Now, when I try to
run my program, the system complains that it cannot find the mpatrol library.
How do I get this to work?

You need to tell the system where to find the shared library version of the
mpatrol library, either by setting your @env{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} environment
variable (or just @env{PATH} on Windows platforms), or by embedding the full
path to the library into the executable when you link your program by setting
the @env{LD_RUN_PATH} environment variable.

@cindex backwards compatibility
@item
I linked my program to a shared library version of mpatrol.  Will future
releases of mpatrol remain compatible with this version or will I have to relink
my program?

Backwards compatibility is not generally guaranteed, but should be preserved if
only the bug fix part of the mpatrol version number has changed, with the major
and minor versions staying the same.  For example, versions 1.0.3 and 1.0.8
should be compatible, but upgrading to version 1.1.0 may require a relink.

@item
I have linked my program with the DLL version of the mpatrol library on Windows
but it crashes when I run it.  I suspect that the crash is occurring when the
mpatrol library is being initialised, so what is going wrong?

There appears to be a problem when using the mpatrol DLL and the static version
of the Microsoft C run-time library, and also a problem when using the static
version of mpatrol and the Microsoft C run-time library DLL.  Luckily, if you
ensure that you use either both static libraries or both DLLs at the same time
then the problem should go away.  There doesn't seem to be an easier way around
it at this time or, for that matter, an explanation for why it happens.

@item
Why are mpatrol library functions not called from shared libraries on AIX?

AIX uses static shared libraries instead of dynamic shared libraries, which
means that all shared library bindings are resolved at link time rather than
load time (i.e.@: you must specify which shared libraries resolve all of the
undefined symbols that result when building a shared library).  If you would
like mpatrol library functions to be called from a shared library, you must
rebuild the shared library with @option{-lmpatrol} on the link line.  However,
this means that you cannot override @code{malloc()}, etc.@:, in shared libraries
that you cannot rebuild unless you link statically with the archive library
versions instead.

@enumerate 1
@item
I've just linked and run my program with the mpatrol library, but the resulting
log file doesn't contain any useful information.  Why does it not contain a list
of all memory transactions or show any unfreed memory allocations?

By default, the mpatrol library will only write a summary of library settings
and statistics to the log file, and that will only occur on successful program
termination (i.e.@: when @code{exit()} is called).  If this does not appear then
it is likely that your program (or some other library function) called
@code{abort()} due to a fatal error.  However, there are a multitude of
different options that you can pass to the mpatrol library via the
@env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable that will allow you to control what
is logged and what is not.  Note that the @command{mpatrol} command will always
log all calls to allocate, reallocate and free memory by default.

@cindex MP_USE_ATEXIT
@item
Why does my C++ program crash at program termination when it is linked with the
mpatrol library and it appears to be doing nothing wrong?

If your program contains file-scope objects whose constructors get called before
@code{main()} and whose destructors get called after @code{main()} then it is
likely that one of these destructors is allocating memory after the mpatrol
library has terminated.  This should already be resolved if you built the
mpatrol library on a platform that supports @samp{.init} and @samp{.fini}
sections or if you built it with the GNU compiler or a C++ compiler.  However,
in certain circumstances this may not work so you may wish to try terminating
the mpatrol library by getting it to register itself with @code{atexit()}
instead, which will hopefully resolve the problem.  You can do this by
rebuilding the mpatrol library with the @code{MP_USE_ATEXIT} preprocessor macro
defined.

@item
I linked my program with the mpatrol library to trace all of its memory
operations, such as @code{memcpy()} and @code{memcmp()}, but I get nothing in
the log file.  Why is this?

On systems that do not support @samp{.init} and @samp{.fini} sections or are
not @command{gcc} or C++ based then the memory operation functions will not
automatically initialise the mpatrol library since on many systems the startup
routines call them very early on.  On such systems, if your program does not
call any memory allocation functions to initialise the mpatrol library then you
must explicitly call the @code{__mp_init()} function.  All memory operation
functions following that call with then be traced.

@item
Why does the @option{USEDEBUG} option not work for me?

Firstly, you have to ensure that you have built the mpatrol library with support
for the GNU BFD object file access library by compiling with the
@code{FORMAT=FORMAT_BFD} preprocessor macro definition, or you are running on a
Windows platform.  Secondly, you have to ensure that you have compiled all
relevant object files with debugging information enabled (usually by adding an
option to the compiler command line), although the mpatrol library does not need
to be compiled this way.  The file and line number information will hopefully
then appear in the log file for all symbols that have associated debugging
information.  If none of the above suggestions work, you may still be able to
get this information with the @command{mpsym} command.

@item
Why does the @command{mpatrol} command ignore the current value of the
@env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable?

Because I would most likely get lots of bug reports or queries from people who
had forgotten that they had set some options in the environment variable and had
then not seen the expected behaviour from the options they specified to the
@command{mpatrol} command.  Recently, though, I've added the @option{--read-env}
option so that this can be achieved.

@item
Why do I get an error from the dynamic linker about not being able to locate
@file{libiberty.so} and @file{libintl.so} when I use the @option{--dynamic}
option with the @command{mpatrol} command?

The GNU libiberty and libintl libraries are required when the mpatrol library is
built with support for the GNU BFD library but are unfortunately only available
in archive form on many systems.  See the section on the @command{mpatrol}
command (@pxref{The mpatrol command}) for information on how to get around this
problem, either by embedding these libraries into the mpatrol library when you
are building it, or by converting the archive forms of these libraries into
their corresponding shared library versions.

@item
Why does the mpatrol library not read the symbols in my executable file on
Windows platforms?

If the mpatrol library was compiled with the @code{FORMAT=FORMAT_IMGHLP}
preprocessor macro defined then you must ensure that you compile your files with
debugging information enabled (using the @option{-Z7} or @option{-Zi} options in
Visual C++) and that you tell the linker that you wish to preserve the debugging
information in the executable file (using the @option{-debug} and
@option{-pdb:none} options in the Microsoft linker).  Unfortunately, if you do
not do this then the final executable file will not have a symbol table and so
the mpatrol library cannot give symbolic stack tracebacks.

@cindex frame pointer
@item
Why do some mpatrol log file entries only contain a partial call stack rather
than following the function call stack back to the call to @code{main()}?

This could be because the mpatrol library was compiled with limited call stack
traversal support via the @code{MP_BUILTINSTACK_SUPPORT} configuration macro.
However, it could also mean that the mpatrol library encountered a corrupt frame
pointer when traversing the call stack and had to terminate the recursion.  The
frame pointer @emph{must} be preserved from function to function on most
platforms, otherwise the stack cannot be traversed.  See your compiler manual
for further details.

@item
I am trying to use the @command{mpatrol} command to debug an executable file
that was not originally compiled with the mpatrol library.  However, even though
it runs successfully, no mpatrol log file is produced.  Why is this?

First, check that you are passing the @option{--dynamic} option to the
@command{mpatrol} command and, if necessary, the @option{--threads} option as
well.  If that doesn't work then check that the executable file has been
dynamically linked; statically linked executables cannot be forced to use the
mpatrol library.  If it still doesn't work then it may be that the dynamic
linker on your system doesn't have the ability to preload any shared libraries
that have been specified in a special environment variable, in which case you
can't use this feature.

@item
I am attempting to run a multithreaded C++ program with the mpatrol library on
Linux.  However, my program crashes before @code{main()} and the debugger shows
that the failure is in @code{__sigaction()} which is called from
@code{__mp_initsignals()}.  Is the fault with the mpatrol library?

There have been many reports of this problem and it turns out to be an issue
with shared library dependencies.  ELF shared libraries may contain
initialisation functions that are executed before @code{main()}.  However,
sometimes the order in which these functions are executed is critical.  In this
case it is likely that the mpatrol and pthreads libraries are being initialised
in the wrong order.  You must ensure that @option{-lpthread} appears near the
very end of the link line after all user libraries, and you must also ensure
that none of the user libraries have a dependency on @file{libpthread.so}.  You
can verify this by running the @command{ldd} command on them.

@item
I know that there's a definite heap corruption problem in my program as it keeps
crashing in unrelated code due to pointer corruption, and when I link with the
mpatrol library it stops crashing.  What can I do?

Try as many of the relevant mpatrol run-time options as possible and make sure
that you closely examine the mpatrol log file for warnings and errors --- your
problem may have been noticed by the mpatrol library but it may not have
considered it a fatal error and continued execution.  If this still doesn't show
up anything then you can probably rest assured that you have a memory corruption
problem but you may need to use a commercial product such as Purify to isolate
it.  If that fails then you'll just have to employ the traditional debugging
method of single-stepping through your program in a debugger until something
unusual or unexpected happens.

@item
If I link my program to version 1.0 of the mpatrol library then I cannot
interrupt it using the keyboard, which I would normally be able to do without
using mpatrol.  Is this a bug?

Not really, but it is undesirable behaviour in most cases, which is why it was
removed in later releases of mpatrol and replaced with the @option{SAFESIGNALS}
option.  The reason that the program could not be interrupted using the keyboard
was that mpatrol would ignore such signals when its library code was being
executed, otherwise user-defined signal handlers that used @code{malloc()} and
related functions would have the capability to cause lots of undesirable side
effects.  However, this does not normally happen, which is why the behaviour was
moved to an option for those that needed it.

@item
Why does mpatrol not report an illegal memory access when it can be detected by
a debugger?

First of all, illegal memory accesses can only be detected on systems that
support virtual memory, so that precludes AmigaOS and Netware.  Secondly, it
might be possible that something is overriding the illegal memory access handler
that mpatrol sets up when it is first initialised.  If your program, or an
external library, sets up a signal handler that handles @code{SIGBUS} or
@code{SIGSEGV} (or their equivalent on Windows platforms) then mpatrol will no
longer be able to catch illegal memory accesses.  You can either try to live
with that, or you could try disabling the overriding handlers.

@item
How do I set a breakpoint on the @code{malloc()} function when it is implemented
as a preprocessor macro in @file{mpatrol.h}?

There are four different mpatrol interface functions which are used to allocate
memory, duplicate strings, reallocate memory and deallocate memory.  If you look
in @file{mpatrol.h} you should be able to see the name of the function that will
be called when the macro is invoked.  The same goes for the memory operation
functions.

@cindex core file
@item
I've linked and run my program with mpatrol under UNIX and it uses a large
amount of heap memory.  However, it crashes near the end of execution and then
proceeds to freeze up the whole system, sometimes requiring a reboot.  What am I
doing wrong?

The most common possible explanation for this is that you are running your
program with too much access to system resources.  What is likely to be
happening is that when your program crashes the system attempts to dump the
entire process image to a core file for later debugging in a non-symbolic
debugger.  If the process has a huge heap then the core file is also going to be
huge, thus resulting in a massive file that may lead to the system thrashing
while it attempts to write it to the disk.  Technically, the system has not
frozen, but it is likely to take a long time to finish writing the file.  The
best solution involves setting your program's maximum core file size to a
reasonable limit (or just zero), and also possibly limiting your program's
maximum data segment size as well.  These can be set from the shell but the
exact details on how to do this differ between shells.

@item
Why does my program run so slowly after I link it with the mpatrol library?

Normal malloc libraries are optimised for speed but will typically fall over at
the slightest hint of an error.  Debugging malloc libraries are written to
provide as much debugging information as possible whilst performing a multitude
of additional checks, which is why they may run much slower.  However, you can
control which checks are performed (and when) by using the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}
environment variable.  Performance may also be lost if you make lots of small
memory allocations rather than fewer larger allocations, but that is mainly due
to the overhead of storing the extra tracing details for each memory allocation.

@item
My program is written in C++ and is linked to the mpatrol library, but how do I
go about demangling the C++ symbol names that are shown in the stack tracebacks
in the resulting log file?

Because there is no standard way of mangling C++ symbol names, various compilers
and operating systems have taken different approaches to C++ name mangling, many
of which differ significantly from the method suggested in @emph{The Annotated
C++ Reference Manual} by Margaret Ellis and Bjarne Stroustrup.  However, most
compilers come with a demangling tool which can be used in a command pipe to
accept mangled names on its standard input file stream and demangle them on its
standard output file stream, and so can be used to process the mpatrol log file.
Note that mpatrol automatically demangles C++ symbol names on Windows platforms
as Microsoft's name mangling is quite unreadable and would be hard to demangle
using a command line tool.

@item
Why does my program not stop when the mpatrol library notices an error?

The library was written to give as much information as possible and so
sometimes, when a non-fatal error is discovered, the library will write the
error message to the log file and continue in the hope of being able to uncover
more errors during the execution of the program.  This means that you should
always check the number of warnings and errors given in the summary at the end
of program execution, and then search backwards in the log file for
@samp{WARNING} or @samp{ERROR}.

@item
I have linked my program with the mpatrol library on an Amiga or Netware
machine, but when it runs it still crashes the entire system.  Why is this?

AmigaOS and Netware do not have virtual memory and so do not have memory
protection turned on by default.  This means that any rogue write to an
erroneous address may actually overwrite the data of another process or perhaps
even the operating system, thus bringing the entire machine down.  There are
several third-party system utilities available for the Amiga to add memory
protection to machines with built-in MMUs, which can then be used in conjunction
with mpatrol.  I'm not sure about the availability of such software for Netware.

@item
I have built the mpatrol library with @command{gcc} on AmigaOS and have
successfully linked it to my program.  However, why are none of the options in
the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable recognised when I run it?

The @code{getenv()} function in the GNU C library is not compatible with the
AmigaDOS @command{SetEnv} and @command{GetEnv} commands since it does not treat
environment variables as files located in @file{ENV:} and is only compatible
with software that uses the ixemul library.  However, the @command{env} command
that comes with most GNU software distributions allows you to set an environment
variable that the GNU @code{getenv()} function can read when you are running in
AmigaDOS.

@cindex bit bucket
@item
How do I suppress all diagnostic output from the mpatrol library?

You can do this by setting the mpatrol log file to be your system's @emph{bit
bucket}, which is @file{/dev/null} on UNIX platforms and @file{NIL:} on AmigaOS.
There doesn't appear to be an equivalent way to do this on Windows or Netware.

@item
Why is there a @file{libmpatrol.o} target in the UNIX and Amiga
@file{Makefile}s?

This is simply used to build the mpatrol library as one large object file for
full incorporation into other libraries and was used during the development of
mpatrol.  On UNIX platforms some linkers support the @option{-r} option for
combining many object files into one large object file, but this is not
universally supported, hence the reason for using the compiler instead.  Because
all of the source files are compiled at once, there may be conflicts with system
header files when @code{malloc()} and its related functions are being compiled,
which is why such an object file is not built by default.  In addition,
platforms which require the assembler routines in @file{machine.c} cannot build
the mpatrol library as one large object file from @file{library.c}.  Note that
the Windows and Netware @file{Makefile}s use @file{libmpatrol.obj}.

@cindex Subversion
@item
What are the @file{.svn} subdirectories that come with the mpatrol distribution?

SVN is short for Subversion and is a project version control system.  All of
the source files that comprise an mpatrol release are stored in a central
Subversion repository so that previous releases can be easily retrieved, but
the Subversion system needs to have a way of determining the versions of
currently checked-out files, hence the @file{.svn} subdirectories.

@item
Why does the @command{mpsym} command not work for me?

Firstly, you have to ensure that you have compiled all relevant object files
with debugging information enabled (usually by adding an option to the compiler
command line).  The file and line number information will hopefully then appear
in the log file for all symbols that have associated debugging information when
you run the @command{mpsym} command on the log file.  Alternatively, it could be
that your system does not have @command{gdb} or any of the required UNIX text
processing tools installed, in which case you might want to try installing them.

@item
How can I customise the @command{mpedit} command if I do not have the
appropriate permissions to edit the file that was installed on my system?

You just need to take a copy of the installed @command{mpedit} command and place
it somewhere that will be picked up earlier on your command search path.  You
can then edit your copy of the file and add support for your favourite text
editor.

The mpatrol library was designed to solve most common heap-related problems,
but there may be some cases where a different approach is needed, or a
commercial package is required.  I have attempted to provide an overview of
the different types of malloc libraries and memory debuggers available below,
along with a comprehensive list of related software.

The most basic type of heap debugging system simply requires the redefinition
of @code{malloc()}, @code{realloc()} and @code{free()} (and related functions)
with debugging versions that record the file and line number at which
allocations occur.  This might require modifications to the source code in order
to call these new functions or it can be done through preprocessor macros which
will require all source files using the memory allocation functions to be
recompiled.  Such a system will most likely live on top of the existing system
malloc library, but will provide an additional layer with which to store more
information for debugging purposes.  MEM by Walter Bright is a good example of
this type of library.

On many operating systems it is usually possible to write replacements for the
normal memory allocation routines and place them in a library so that they can
be linked in to override the system malloc library without requiring
recompilation of any source files.  Such malloc libraries must take control of
the heap directly and so usually contain more features, including being able to
track memory leaks and place fence posts around allocations.  Dbmalloc by Conor
P. Cahill and Dmalloc by Gray Watson are two of the most popular of these types
of libraries since they are available on a wide range of platforms.  Electric
Fence by Bruce Perens also makes use of the memory protection facilities found
in UNIX systems in order to force programs that access free or freed memory or
read or write beyond the bounds of a memory allocation to crash at the point
that the illegal memory access is made, rather than crashing at the next memory
allocation.

@cindex instrumentation
For debugging all memory access errors (not just those on the heap) it is
necessary to modify (instrument) the machine code that is to be run so that each
individual load from memory and store to memory will be checked.  One method of
doing this is to modify the code produced by a compiler (such as is done by
Checker written by Tristan Gingold) but this has the disadvantage of only
working within the object files that have been produced by that compiler.  It is
also possible to modify the source code itself using source to source
translation (such as is done by Parasoft Insure++) or instrument all accesses to
memory in assembler source files (as performed by APurify written by Samuel
Devulder).  However, both of these methods suffer from the same drawback as
compiler-generated instrumentation.  Yet another alternative is to wait until
link-time and then instrument the individual object files and libraries before
they are linked into an executable file.  This is effectively what Purify from
Rational Software does, although Memory Advisor from PLATINUM Technology does
roughly the same except that it disassembles the object files into a
platform-independent format before instrumenting them.

@cindex memory debugger
Rather than modifying a program in order to add debugging code, it is sometimes
possible to use a dedicated memory debugger in order to quickly catch any
problems.  ZeroFault from The Kernel Group debugs all memory-related operations
in a program while it is running, whilst AProbe from OC Systems allows users to
dynamically add probe modules at run-time in order to locate errors or perform
profiling.  If such a memory debugger is not available for your system, you may
still be able to dynamically link a malloc library into your application at
run-time if the operating system supports it.  NJAMD by Mike Perry makes
extensive use of this feature on some UNIX systems.  On operating systems that
do not support virtual memory but have hardware memory protection, it is
sometimes possible to trap memory errors before they bring down the whole
system.  On the Amiga, Enforcer by Michael Sinz runs in the background and
detects many common memory access errors in running applications, whilst on the
Macintosh, QC by Onyx Technology provides roughly the same functionality.

A list of over ninety five different items of software which help in debugging
dynamic memory allocation problems is given below@footnote{This list can be
considered to be a slightly more up to date version of @cite{Debugging Tools
for Dynamic Storage Allocation and Memory Management}
(@uref{http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~zorn/MallocDebug.html}) by Ben Zorn.}.  They
all provide some of the features that mpatrol contains and you may wish to use
one of them to solve your problem if you have trouble using mpatrol.  I have
only ever used CSRI malloc, Dbmalloc, Dmalloc, Electric Fence and Mprof, so I
can't vouch for any of the others, although if you have any recommendations
feel free to let me know so I can add them to this list.  In particular, there
seems to be a shortage of such programs for Netware platforms.  Note that there
is a comparison of a few of the following programs at
@uref{http://www.consistent.org/terran/memorycheck.shtml} which might help
illustrate the differences between the various tools.

@cindex Solaris malloc libraries
@cindex malloc libraries for Solaris
However, before you try out any of the above software, there may already be a
malloc library with debugging support on your system that might be suitable for
solving your problem.  For example, on Solaris the following libraries are
available:

@table @cite
@cindex malloc(3c)
@item malloc(3c)
Trade-off between performance and efficiency.
@cindex malloc(3x)
@item malloc(3x)
Slower performance, space-efficient.
@cindex bsdmalloc(3x)
@item bsdmalloc(3x)
Better performance, space-inefficient.
@cindex mtmalloc(3t)
@item mtmalloc(3t)
Thread-safe memory allocator.
@cindex mapmalloc(3x)
@item mapmalloc(3x)
Uses @code{mmap()} instead of @code{sbrk()} to allocate heap space.
@cindex watchmalloc(3x)
@item watchmalloc(3x)
Uses watch point areas to check for overflows.
@end table

@cindex GNU C library
On platforms with the GNU C library, such as Linux, there are several
environment variables that can be used to enable various debugging features of
@code{malloc()}, etc.  There are also extra functions provided in the library
which can be used to aid in debugging, and some shell scripts which can
translate return addresses or locate unfreed memory allocations in the log files
produced.  Useful information on the debugging features available within the
GNU C library is located at @uref{http://sdb.suse.de/sdb/en/html/aj_debug.html}.

@cindex strace
@cindex truss
If you suspect that the debugging problem you are looking at is likely to be
related to UNIX system calls then some systems come with the @command{strace}
or @command{truss} commands which allow you to trace all of the system calls
that a program makes when running.  This can sometimes be invaluable in
pinpointing the exact point at which a program fails, but as it only operates
at the system call level, no information about individual memory allocations is
available.

@cindex pageheap
On Windows 2000 (and probably later releases of the operating system as well)
there is a utility called @command{pageheap} which acts in a similar way to the
@command{mpatrol} command in that it overrides the definitions of
@code{malloc()} and related functions for any programs that it runs.  It has
a similar behaviour to the @option{--page-alloc-upper} option but has far less
features.  However, it could be very useful if you can't get mpatrol to work
for you.

@cindex author, details

@cindex Edinburgh
@cindex Scotland
@cindex University of Edinburgh
@cindex CCIR
I live just outside Edinburgh (the capital city of Scotland) and work at the
University of Edinburgh in the Centre for Communication Interface Research
(CCIR).  I am currently also working towards gaining a PhD in Usability
Engineering.

@cindex Edinburgh Portable Compilers
@cindex EPC
@cindex Analog Devices
@cindex ADI
I used to work for an American company called Analog Devices which designs and
manufactures digital and analogue electronic equipment, as well as Digital
Signal Processors (DSPs).  Before that I worked for Edinburgh Portable
Compilers, a small Edinburgh-based company which designed, wrote and sold
compilers for various programming languages and operating systems (mainly UNIX
variants).  In 2000 it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Analog Devices and
the focus was shifted to write C and C++ compilers for the various ADI DSPs.

I started working at EPC immediately after obtaining my honours degree in
Computer Science at Edinburgh University.  My interests lie in operating systems
and programming tools so this was an ideal working environment for me to apply
my knowledge and learn more about the bits and pieces that most programmers and
computer users know little or nothing about.

Writing compilers is a complex business that most people take for granted.  The
popular view is that once you have a lexer and a parser for a particular
programming language then you are 90% of the way to having a compiler.  However,
modern compilers are required to perform more and more aggressive optimisations
on user code, all of which require complex algorithms, and most of which are
applied at the code-generator level.  Add accurate debugging information
generation, C++ exceptions and templates, inline assembler support and an
efficient run-time library and you begin to see why writing and maintaining a
compiler is not a solo effort!

I originally wrote the mpatrol library in my spare time with the intention of
selling it to EPC as a comprehensive memory debugging solution for integration
with their UNIX compilers.  Unfortunately, EPC was taken over by ADI before it
was finished and ADI had no use for such a library in their DSP toolchain.
However, I still feel that it was worth the effort (not least because of all the
knowledge of other operating systems that I gained whilst writing it), and I
hope you do too!

freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
